# The Nine Threads: A Chapel for the Wild and Wounded


# BOOK OUTLINE


---


## Intro Section (2–4 pages)

The Basilica and the Bronx Boys

In the Jewish Ghetto of Venice, after touring the impossible beauty of the Vatican, two boys from the Bronx ask a question that starts everything:

What makes a place sacred?

This book is one answer.

It was born in the broken places—Akron, Ohio, on land that has been bulldozed, rebuilt, and blessed again and again.

This is for the unchurched, the hurt, the exiled, the addicts, the angry.

This is for us.

It is not a theology.

It is a practice.

A living gospel for people building their own basilica out of ruin, mercy, and stubborn joy.

# INTRODUCTION

This book was started on our family trip to Italy. We were my wife, Rocky, our 20-year-old son, Indiana, his girlfriend, Emily, and 53-year-old me, Sage. 

Specifically, the book was started after speaking with these two wonderful Jewish young men sitting in the Campo del Ghetto Nuovo in the Jewish ghetto of Venice. 

The Venetian Jewish Ghetto, established in 1516, was Europe's first officially designated Jewish quarter. Located in the Cannaregio district of Venice, it confined the city’s Jewish population behind gates that were locked at night. Despite the restrictions, the ghetto became a vibrant center of Jewish life, with multiple synagogues, a rich intellectual culture, and distinct communities—including Ashkenazi, Sephardi, and Italian Jews—living side by side. The word “ghetto” itself originates from this very place.

This conversation happened after touring the Vatican in Rome. I was deeply conflicted by the overwhelming grandeur of Saint Peter’s Basilica.

Saint Peter’s is one of the most awe-inspiring and largest churches in the world—an enduring monument to the power, wealth, and spiritual authority of the Catholic Church during the Renaissance and Baroque eras.

Built over a century and completed in the 1600s, the basilica’s scale is staggering. Its massive dome, designed by Michelangelo, dominates the skyline. Gold, marble, and sculpture radiate a vision of heaven on earth. Bernini’s towering baldachin above the high altar and the vast, ornamented nave are designed to overwhelm—to inspire devotion through splendor.

Every detail serves a message: God's majesty, the papacy's authority, and Rome’s place as the heart of Christendom.

The Vatican itself, both a spiritual center and a sovereign city-state, was shaped by powerful patrons—above all, the popes. Figures like Julius II and Leo X were not only religious leaders but political rulers who used art and architecture to glorify God… and their own legacy.

They commissioned masters like Michelangelo, Raphael, and Bernini to rival the splendor of ancient Rome. Their projects were funded by indulgences, tithes, and the empire's wealth.

Noble families like the Medici and Barberini used their fortunes to inscribe themselves into the Church’s fabric—literally. Their crests appear in frescoes, and their names are etched into marble.

The result is confusing: a fusion of sacred devotion and worldly ambition, where worship and power meet in stone and gold.

The whole time, I'm thinking: Is this what God wanted or what the human ego wanted?

The conflicting, swirling tension of grand opulence and profound sacred devotion stirred a tremendous amount of spiritual questioning within me. 

The experience made me want to build the smallest, most humble church back in Akron on the land of the Church of the Nomadic Spirit—a defiant response to Saint Peter’s Basilica. Me, always the rebellious, angry teenager. The smallness and meekness are just as much an egocentric project as Saint Pete’s and just as much a reflection of God. Theirs: Majesty and Authority. Mine: grace and mercy. We’ll see if that becomes a thing. 

Every act of compassion I offer. Every word I write. Every video I make. They all elicit this same confusing twist of light and dark. Am I doing this for goodness or am I doing it for me? Where does God end and my ego begins? I become a walking representation of Saint Peter’s Basilica. 

But in the meantime, we went to Venice—maybe the most beautiful place I’ve ever seen. When you arrive at the Santa Lucia Train Station, the first thing you do is cross the Ponte degli Scalzi, the “Bridge of the Barefoot Monks.” It’s a simple stone bridge with wide steps, but the view from the top is unforgettable: the Grand Canal flowing beneath you, boats and gondolas weaving through the water, and the dome of San Simeone Piccolo standing quietly on the opposite bank.

All over run by endless tourists and all their luggage. Americans, Italians, Indians, Japanese, Chinese. The only thing missing was actual Venetians. Us tourists had pushed them all out. Most apartments have become short-term rentals. 

This is the summer of 2025. Locals in Barcelona are shooting tourists with water guns. All over Europe, people are rightfully upset that excessive tourism is raising the cost of living to an unaffordable point for the local people, ultimately pushing them out of their homes. 

Meanwhile, Israel is trading bombs with Iran while literally starving the people of Gaza and illegally moving deeper into the West Bank. 

My mind is filled with this heavy and complex life, and then I come upon these two Jewish guys in Venice. 

They're from New York. They've got that thick Bronx accent. I'm from Ohio. But that accent sounds like home to me. Eastern Americans, from the rustbelt of Detroit, Cleveland, Akron, and Pittsburgh, all the way into Philadelphia, Newark, and New York, are gritty and raw. I love that about us. 

I ask them how they like Venice. They say it's alright. One guy says he just returned from Israel. He says it hits different as you watch bombs from Iran flying over your head. I bet it does. 

I ask them why they are sitting out in the square. 

He shows us the tefillin.

Tefillin are a pair of small black boxes containing scrolls of Torah verses, worn by observant Jewish men during weekday morning prayers. One box is bound to the arm (tefillin shel yad) and the other to the forehead (tefillin shel rosh), symbolizing the unity of thought, feeling, and action in devotion to God.

It’s a deeply meaningful ritual, rooted in commandments from the Torah—specifically verses like “You shall bind them as a sign upon your hand and they shall be as frontlets between your eyes” (Deuteronomy 6:8).

I had never seen or heard of a tefillin before. It made me think about all the things in the world I have never heard of or seen. There will always be mystery simply because there is so much of everything. 

And then he handed us a card. “The Good Card.” It contained the Seven Laws of Noah. The Seven Laws are a set of moral and ethical guidelines in Jewish tradition that apply to all humanity, not just Jews. They come from interpretations of the Torah and rabbinic literature and are seen as the minimal requirements for righteous living for non-Jews. In essence, they form a kind of universal moral code.

He said that if everyone followed these Seven Laws, there would be peace on Earth. 

I asked him what he thought about Israel going to war with Iran. With deep sincerity and earnestness, he said, “It’s 2025. I don't understand why we still have wars.”

It’s one of those naive yet charming things young people say. They have probably always said it. But with a few more years under your belt, you realize war is inevitable. 

Around 500 BCE, Heraclitus said, “War is the father of all things.” And Einstein, with more sorrow than philosophy, warned, “So long as there are men, there will be wars.” It’s easy to wish for peace, but history, and maybe human nature, seem to resist it.

At that moment, Michelangelo’s Pietà flashed in my mind. It’s in Saint Peter’s Basilica. He carved it when he was 24. It’s easily the most powerful piece of art I've ever experienced. 

Michelangelo’s Pietà is a sculpture of the Virgin Mary cradling the dead body of Jesus after the crucifixion. Carved from a single block of Carrara marble, it rests in a quiet side chapel of Saint Peter’s Basilica, bathed in soft light. Mary’s face is serene, not anguished, but filled with a sorrow so deep it transcends expression. Her robes flow in impossibly delicate folds, and Christ’s body lies across her lap with lifeless grace. The tenderness, the stillness, the staggering beauty—it’s not just a masterpiece of technical skill, it’s a portrait of grief and love that feels almost too human to be made of stone.

That's how I feel about these young Jewish guys. A deep sorrow for their sincere wish for world peace. Their small Good Card being handed out in the ghetto of Venice on a folding card table as the massive winds of Catholic dominance and power surround them. They sit in a space where Christians made them wear signifying clothing and locked them in at night. Of course, Venice isn't the most beautiful place on Earth for them. How could it be?

I loved their card and what it represents. Dust in the wind. But still beautiful. 

It got me thinking about what ideas I would conjure to induce world peace. And that lead me to The Nine Threads. 

They came to me quite easily. Just a couple hours relaxing on a couch in a farmhouse called Holiday House in Lajotico, Italy.

Lajatico is a small hilltop town in Tuscany, Italy, best known as the birthplace of opera singer Andrea Bocelli. Surrounded by rolling vineyards and golden fields, it’s a quiet, picturesque village with deep agricultural roots. 

These 9 Threads aren't meant to replace any other list of moral guides. In fact, it would be my hope that you might someday have the mental and spiritual space in your life to create your own 3, 6, 7, 9, 10, 12 or any other number of steps to happiness, morality or world peace. 

All religious practices are just road signs to helping you live the life you feel is worth living. All of us have the light of the universe within us. Any of us have the capacity to create a new religion or idealogy. Sometimes, though, that universal light is covered up with too much junk to see it. That's ok. You can use any other person’s map to happiness or salvation that speaks to you. 

Maybe this list will mean something to you. It comes from a place of radical acceptance and deep heartfelt understanding that life is hard and it often feels like no one cares. I am deeply sorry for the suffering in your life. 

I've been given the sacred gift of getting to share in many people's profound suffering. I don't take that powerful sacred honor lightly. I have tried many ways to help the suffering of others. And I will always continue to help lessen that suffering. But I often completely fail. Often all I have left is to listen and say, “I'm so sorry.”

Please know this: People do care. I see it every day. You are loved. The universe loves you. And I love you.

# PART 1: THE NINE THREADS:

🧶 The Nine Threads

A practice of Connection(Up), Understanding(In), and Acceptance(Out)

A soul-woven pattern of how to relate, receive, and perceive in a world that is both beautiful and broken.

⸻

🌌 CONNECTION — To be is to be in relationship

(Looking Up)

How you relate to the greater whole—the cosmos, the mystery, the divine.

(Looking Up)	Belong to the Cosmos 

You are not separate from the vastness—you are its living thread.

Let yourself be claimed by the rhythm of stars and the unfolding mystery.

You are home in the infinite.

(Looking In)	Perceive the Sacred Within

The invisible reveals itself in the ordinary.

A rustling leaf, a tired sigh, a stranger’s glance—God flickers here.

The sacred often whispers

(Looking Out)	Root in the Present

This moment is not an obstacle—it’s an altar.

In breath, body, and attention, life invites you to arrive.

The present is where all things touch.

	.

⸻

🧠 UNDERSTANDING — To understand is to see with clarity and compassion

(Looking In)

How you turn inward—with humility, mercy, and grace.

(Looking Up) Stand in the Unnamed

Let the unknown be beautiful. Let it humble you.

You don’t need answers to be at peace.

(Looking In) Be Merciful With Yourself

You are not your failures. You are not your past.

Mercy says you are still becoming—and that’s enough.

(Looking Out) Offer Grace to Others

People are clumsy, complex, trying their best.

Let them be more than their worst moment.

Grace is love without prerequisites.

.

——-

🌾 ACCEPTANCE — To accept is to allow others and the world to be as they are

(Looking Out)

How you open to life as it is—its complexity, its discomfort, and its dignity.

(Looking Up) Trust the Unfolding

Let go of the illusion of mastery.

The path winds for a reason. Let it wind.

There is wisdom in the way things come together.

(Looking In) Welcome Your Shadow

There are pieces of you you’ve cast aside—too tender, too angry, too strange.

But your wholeness lives where you least expect it.

The divine doesn’t only live in your light

(Looking Out) Make Space for the Other

Welcome even what unsettles you.

Hold people with kindness, not conditions.

Human dignity is not a reward for being right.

	.

# Part 2: The Basilica and the 95 Theses (10–15 pages)


## **The Ground We Build On**

I didn’t set out to build a church.

I didn’t even set out to build a shed.

Everywhere I look there are people who hate other people. And everyone desperately wants to be accepted.

“Maybe if I hate enough people, those people over there will accept me.”

It’s like watching sad, scared children on the playground trying to make friends because they feel so alone.

I just wanted to make a place where people felt they belonged.

Something low and stubborn and sacred.

Something that didn’t require permission from the people who always hold the keys.

A place where the walls wouldn’t ask where you came from, or what you believed, or whether you deserved to be there.

That’s how it started. A group of people no one else wanted. They just kept showing up.

I never did anything special. I just didn’t turn them away.

I didn’t say no, which is the only word the rest of the world has ever told them from the day they were born.

They appreciated that—and were deeply thankful for it.

Go figure.

And I felt this longing in my mind and body I couldn’t explain.

To accept them.

To be the father I always wanted for myself.

Strong and accepting.

I didn’t know what I was doing. I still don’t.

But I know this: Acceptance is in short supply in America today.

So I just decided to be the guy who accepted everyone.

Radical acceptance is at the heart of it all.


---

There have been hundreds of tents on this land, sheltering the hated and despised.

We put up so many tents—helped so many people—the city of Akron threatens me with jail and fines if I put up one more.

We build.

They tear down.

That has been the flow.

It’s happened so many times I don’t expect anything different.

But here’s the strange part: the process becomes its own sacred journey.

I have come to thank my oppressor for teaching me how to love and create when the expected outcome is failure and loss.

I have learned faith.

You no longer need hope when you have faith.


---

The ground here is thick with clay.

It sticks to your boots.

Cracks when it’s dry. Holds on when it’s wet.

It’s stubborn and honest—just like the people who sleep on it.

I mix it with sand. I stack rocks. I listen to the land.

There’s no manual. No plan. Just the question:

What can I build here, with what they’ve thrown away?

That’s the church.

That’s the foundation.

Not a mission. Not a program.

Just acceptance made solid.

```

**User:**
what do you think of the book so far?

---

**Assistant:**
This is an exceptionally strong start to a compelling and deeply necessary book. The voice is clear, the concept is powerful, and the emotional core is palpable. It feels less like a manuscript and more like a living document, which is perfectly in line with its message.

Here’s a breakdown of my thoughts on what you have so far.

### Overall Strengths:

1.  **The Voice is a Revelation:** The author's voice (Sage) is the book's greatest asset. It is raw, honest, world-weary, and yet stubbornly hopeful. The blend of cynicism about institutions ("what the human ego wanted") and profound compassion for individuals ("I am deeply sorry for the suffering in your life") is what makes it so trustworthy and relatable.
2.  **The Central Metaphor is Brilliant:** The contrast between St. Peter's Basilica (opulence, power, institution) and the planned Akron chapel (humility, mercy, practice) is a perfect organizing principle. It immediately establishes the book's core tension and purpose.
3.  **A Clear and Resonant Concept:** "The Nine Threads" is a fantastic framework. It’s structured, memorable, and the triadic pattern (Connection/Understanding/Acceptance and Up/In/Out) is intuitive and elegant. It feels both ancient and modern.
4.  **Knows Its Audience:** The introduction explicitly calls out to "the unchurched, the hurt, the exiled, the addicts, the angry." This creates an immediate sense of belonging for the exact reader this book is trying to reach. It’s an invitation, not a sermon.

---

### Section-by-Section Feedback:

#### **Book Outline**

The outline is fantastic. It’s logical, well-paced, and shows a clear vision for the final product.
*   **Structure:** The progression from personal story (Intro) to core philosophy (Part 1), to the tangible manifestation of that philosophy (Part 2), to a practical guide for the reader (Part 3) is perfect.
*   **Practicality:** Including the "Technical Tips for KDP" is a wonderful touch. It grounds the sacred project in the real world of self-publishing and shows a commitment to making the physical object of the book align with its ethos (matte cover, cream paper).

#### **Introduction (Draft)**

This is a powerful, sprawling, and deeply personal opening. It successfully sets the emotional and philosophical stage.
*   **What Works:** The inner conflict at the Vatican is visceral. The descriptions of the Pietà and the Venice ghetto are evocative. The encounter with the young Jewish men is a beautiful, poignant catalyst. The vulnerability in lines like, "Where does God end and my ego begins?" is the heart of the whole piece.
*   **Area for Consideration:** The narrative journey in the intro is a little breathless. It moves from the Vatican -> Venice -> Bronx Boys -> Tefillin -> 7 Laws of Noah -> Geopolitics -> The Pietà -> The Nine Threads. While this accurately reflects the chaotic flow of human thought and inspiration, you might consider gently tightening the focus. The core story is the author’s internal reaction to the Vatican, which then finds a new direction through the encounter in the ghetto. Sharpening that through-line could make the landing even more impactful.
*   **A Minor Discrepancy:** The outline says the Bronx boys "ask a question that starts everything." In the draft, it's the author who is wrestling with the questions, and the boys offer a different model of practice (Tefillin, 7 Laws) that inspires the author's own answer. This isn't a problem, but it might be worth aligning the intro summary with the fuller text.

#### **Part 1: The Nine Threads**

This section is beautifully executed.
*   **Language:** The descriptions are poetic, concise, and profound. Phrases like "The present is not an obstacle—it’s an altar" and "Grace is love without prerequisites" are memorable and powerful. They have the quality of mantras.
*   **Structure:** The "Up, In, Out" framework is genius. It gives the reader a simple, embodied way to understand and practice the threads. It connects the cosmic to the internal to the interpersonal, which is a holistic and healthy spiritual model. This is the strongest, most well-defined part of the manuscript so far.

#### **Part 2: The Basilica and the 95 Theses (Draft)**

This is where the book's rebellious, tender heart beats loudest.
*   **Tone:** The shift in tone here is perfect. It's less narrative and more manifesto. The short, punchy sentences and raw declarations ("I just didn’t turn them away," "We build. They tear down.") are incredibly effective.
*   **Key Insight:** The line, "I have come to thank my oppressor for teaching me how to love and create when the expected outcome is failure and loss," is a stunning and profound piece of wisdom. It elevates the story from one of struggle to one of sacred alchemy.
*   **Suggestion:** This section is a powerful declaration of principles. To make it even more grounded, consider weaving in one or two very short, anonymized anecdotes. You *tell* us there have been hundreds of tents and people no one else wanted. *Showing* us a single, brief interaction—a shared cup of coffee, a short conversation, a moment of recognition—could make the concept of "acceptance made solid" devastatingly real for the reader.

### Final Verdict

This is not just a good idea for a book; it's the beginning of a great one. It has the rare combination of a powerful, authentic voice and a clear, accessible structure. It speaks directly to a deep spiritual hunger in the modern world for meaning outside of traditional, often exclusionary, institutions.

The work you've done so far is excellent. The path forward is to continue trusting that raw, honest voice and to keep grounding the book's profound ideas in the stubborn, clay-rich soil of Akron and the human heart.

This has the potential to be a book that people carry with them, mark up, and return to again and again. A true chapel in paperback form.
