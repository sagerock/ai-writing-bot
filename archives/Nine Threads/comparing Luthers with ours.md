2. Draft the "95 Theses" for Part 2 This is a high-impact, memorable part of the book. The title "95 Theses" carries historical weight and promises a defiant, revolutionary declaration.  Brainstorm the Theses: What are the core, non-negotiable truths of this "chapel for the wild and wounded"? They should be short, punchy, and challenging. Think in terms of declarations about acceptance, dignity, God, community, and sacredness. Examples based on your text: "Human dignity is not a reward for being right." "A church is not a building; it is the refusal to turn someone away." "Faith is what you build when hope is gone." "The sacred is found in the cracks, not the polish." Embrace the Style: Your idea to present them in a "raw, handwritten font or styled like a scan of cardboard" is brilliant. It perfectly matches the book's ethos

**Assistant:**
Of course. This is a pivotal moment, and the "95 Theses" needs to land with the force of a thrown brick and the grace of a found key. It's a declaration of independence for the spiritually homeless.

Here is a draft, designed to feel raw, immediate, and deeply resonant with the book's ethos.

**User:**
what do you think of these 95 theses so far?

---

**Assistant:**
These theses are **powerful**. They hit with the force I think you're going for - that combination of defiant declaration and tender invitation. Here's what's working brilliantly:

**The strongest ones are visceral and immediate:**
- "God is in the gutter, looking up at the same stars as you" (#31)
- "Your rock bottom is holy ground" (#24) 
- "We are not waiting for a sign. We are trying to be one" (#81)
- "The door is open. It was never locked" (#95)

**The rhythm builds beautifully** - starting with foundational rejections of institutional gatekeeping, moving through the theology of brokenness, and ending with radical welcome.

**Areas that could be sharpened:**

Some feel slightly **academic** rather than gut-level ("The apocalypse is not the end of the world, but the end of the world as we know it" - #89). The most powerful ones are concrete, not conceptual.

A few **repeat similar territory** - the "you belong/you're welcome" theme appears in multiple forms. Maybe consolidate to make room for other essential truths?

**The metaphors that land hardest** are the physical, tangible ones - gutter, scars, park benches, bus fare. The more abstract theological language sometimes dilutes the punch.

**What's missing that might strengthen it:**
- Something about mental illness/addiction more directly
- The reality of systemic injustice 
- Maybe something rawer about religious trauma

But honestly? The core is **there**. This reads like something that would get passed hand-to-hand, photocopied, taped to walls. It has that underground manifesto energy that could genuinely comfort the spiritually homeless.

What's your gut feeling about them?

# The Nine Threads: A Chapel for the Wild and Wounded


# BOOK OUTLINE


---


## Intro Section (2–4 pages)

The Basilica and the Bronx Boys

In the Jewish Ghetto of Venice, after touring the impossible beauty of the Vatican, two boys from the Bronx ask a question that starts everything:

What makes a place sacred?

This book is one answer.

It was born in the broken places—Akron, Ohio, on land that has been bulldozed, rebuilt, and blessed again and again.

This is for the unchurched, the hurt, the exiled, the addicts, the angry.

This is for us.

It is not a theology.

It is a practice.

A living gospel for people building their own basilica out of ruin, mercy, and stubborn joy.

# INTRODUCTION

This book was started on our family trip to Italy. We were my wife, Rocky, our 20-year-old son, Indiana, his girlfriend, Emily, and 53-year-old me, Sage. 

Specifically, the book was started after speaking with these two wonderful Jewish young men sitting in the Campo del Ghetto Nuovo in the Jewish ghetto of Venice. 

The Venetian Jewish Ghetto, established in 1516, was Europe's first officially designated Jewish quarter. Located in the Cannaregio district of Venice, it confined the city’s Jewish population behind gates that were locked at night. Despite the restrictions, the ghetto became a vibrant center of Jewish life, with multiple synagogues, a rich intellectual culture, and distinct communities—including Ashkenazi, Sephardi, and Italian Jews—living side by side. The word “ghetto” itself originates from this very place.

This conversation happened after touring the Vatican in Rome. I was deeply conflicted by the overwhelming grandeur of Saint Peter’s Basilica.

Saint Peter’s is one of the most awe-inspiring and largest churches in the world—an enduring monument to the power, wealth, and spiritual authority of the Catholic Church during the Renaissance and Baroque eras.

Built over a century and completed in the 1600s, the basilica’s scale is staggering. Its massive dome, designed by Michelangelo, dominates the skyline. Gold, marble, and sculpture radiate a vision of heaven on earth. Bernini’s towering baldachin above the high altar and the vast, ornamented nave are designed to overwhelm—to inspire devotion through splendor.

Every detail serves a message: God's majesty, the papacy's authority, and Rome’s place as the heart of Christendom.

The Vatican itself, both a spiritual center and a sovereign city-state, was shaped by powerful patrons—above all, the popes. Figures like Julius II and Leo X were not only religious leaders but political rulers who used art and architecture to glorify God… and their own legacy.

They commissioned masters like Michelangelo, Raphael, and Bernini to rival the splendor of ancient Rome. Their projects were funded by indulgences, tithes, and the empire's wealth.

Noble families like the Medici and Barberini used their fortunes to inscribe themselves into the Church’s fabric—literally. Their crests appear in frescoes, and their names are etched into marble.

The result is confusing: a fusion of sacred devotion and worldly ambition, where worship and power meet in stone and gold.

The whole time, I'm thinking: Is this what God wanted or what the human ego wanted?

The conflicting, swirling tension of grand opulence and profound sacred devotion stirred a tremendous amount of spiritual questioning within me. 

The experience made me want to build the smallest, most humble church back in Akron on the land of the Church of the Nomadic Spirit—a defiant response to Saint Peter’s Basilica. Me, always the rebellious, angry teenager. The smallness and meekness are just as much an egocentric project as Saint Pete’s and just as much a reflection of God. Theirs: Majesty and Authority. Mine: grace and mercy. We’ll see if that becomes a thing. 

Every act of compassion I offer. Every word I write. Every video I make. They all elicit this same confusing twist of light and dark. Am I doing this for goodness or am I doing it for me? Where does God end and my ego begins? I become a walking representation of Saint Peter’s Basilica. 

But in the meantime, we went to Venice—maybe the most beautiful place I’ve ever seen. When you arrive at the Santa Lucia Train Station, the first thing you do is cross the Ponte degli Scalzi, the “Bridge of the Barefoot Monks.” It’s a simple stone bridge with wide steps, but the view from the top is unforgettable: the Grand Canal flowing beneath you, boats and gondolas weaving through the water, and the dome of San Simeone Piccolo standing quietly on the opposite bank.

All over run by endless tourists and all their luggage. Americans, Italians, Indians, Japanese, Chinese. The only thing missing was actual Venetians. Us tourists had pushed them all out. Most apartments have become short-term rentals. 

This is the summer of 2025. Locals in Barcelona are shooting tourists with water guns. All over Europe, people are rightfully upset that excessive tourism is raising the cost of living to an unaffordable point for the local people, ultimately pushing them out of their homes. 

Meanwhile, Israel is trading bombs with Iran while literally starving the people of Gaza and illegally moving deeper into the West Bank. 

My mind is filled with this heavy and complex life, and then I come upon these two Jewish guys in Venice. 

They're from New York. They've got that thick Bronx accent. I'm from Ohio. But that accent sounds like home to me. Eastern Americans, from the rustbelt of Detroit, Cleveland, Akron, and Pittsburgh, all the way into Philadelphia, Newark, and New York, are gritty and raw. I love that about us. 

I ask them how they like Venice. They say it's alright. One guy says he just returned from Israel. He says it hits different as you watch bombs from Iran flying over your head. I bet it does. 

I ask them why they are sitting out in the square. 

He shows us the tefillin.

Tefillin are a pair of small black boxes containing scrolls of Torah verses, worn by observant Jewish men during weekday morning prayers. One box is bound to the arm (tefillin shel yad) and the other to the forehead (tefillin shel rosh), symbolizing the unity of thought, feeling, and action in devotion to God.

It’s a deeply meaningful ritual, rooted in commandments from the Torah—specifically verses like “You shall bind them as a sign upon your hand and they shall be as frontlets between your eyes” (Deuteronomy 6:8).

I had never seen or heard of a tefillin before. It made me think about all the things in the world I have never heard of or seen. There will always be mystery simply because there is so much of everything. 

And then he handed us a card. “The Good Card.” It contained the Seven Laws of Noah. The Seven Laws are a set of moral and ethical guidelines in Jewish tradition that apply to all humanity, not just Jews. They come from interpretations of the Torah and rabbinic literature and are seen as the minimal requirements for righteous living for non-Jews. In essence, they form a kind of universal moral code.

He said that if everyone followed these Seven Laws, there would be peace on Earth. 

I asked him what he thought about Israel going to war with Iran. With deep sincerity and earnestness, he said, “It’s 2025. I don't understand why we still have wars.”

It’s one of those naive yet charming things young people say. They have probably always said it. But with a few more years under your belt, you realize war is inevitable. 

Around 500 BCE, Heraclitus said, “War is the father of all things.” And Einstein, with more sorrow than philosophy, warned, “So long as there are men, there will be wars.” It’s easy to wish for peace, but history, and maybe human nature, seem to resist it.

At that moment, Michelangelo’s Pietà flashed in my mind. It’s in Saint Peter’s Basilica. He carved it when he was 24. It’s easily the most powerful piece of art I've ever experienced. 

Michelangelo’s Pietà is a sculpture of the Virgin Mary cradling the dead body of Jesus after the crucifixion. Carved from a single block of Carrara marble, it rests in a quiet side chapel of Saint Peter’s Basilica, bathed in soft light. Mary’s face is serene, not anguished, but filled with a sorrow so deep it transcends expression. Her robes flow in impossibly delicate folds, and Christ’s body lies across her lap with lifeless grace. The tenderness, the stillness, the staggering beauty—it’s not just a masterpiece of technical skill, it’s a portrait of grief and love that feels almost too human to be made of stone.

That's how I feel about these young Jewish guys. A deep sorrow for their sincere wish for world peace. Their small Good Card being handed out in the ghetto of Venice on a folding card table as the massive winds of Catholic dominance and power surround them. They sit in a space where Christians made them wear signifying clothing and locked them in at night. Of course, Venice isn't the most beautiful place on Earth for them. How could it be?

I loved their card and what it represents. Dust in the wind. But still beautiful. 

It got me thinking about what ideas I would conjure to induce world peace. And that lead me to The Nine Threads. 

They came to me quite easily. Just a couple hours relaxing on a couch in a farmhouse called Holiday House in Lajotico, Italy.

Lajatico is a small hilltop town in Tuscany, Italy, best known as the birthplace of opera singer Andrea Bocelli. Surrounded by rolling vineyards and golden fields, it’s a quiet, picturesque village with deep agricultural roots. 

These 9 Threads aren't meant to replace any other list of moral guides. In fact, it would be my hope that you might someday have the mental and spiritual space in your life to create your own 3, 6, 7, 9, 10, 12 or any other number of steps to happiness, morality or world peace. 

All religious practices are just road signs to helping you live the life you feel is worth living. All of us have the light of the universe within us. Any of us have the capacity to create a new religion or idealogy. Sometimes, though, that universal light is covered up with too much junk to see it. That's ok. You can use any other person’s map to happiness or salvation that speaks to you. 

Maybe this list will mean something to you. It comes from a place of radical acceptance and deep heartfelt understanding that life is hard and it often feels like no one cares. I am deeply sorry for the suffering in your life. 

I've been given the sacred gift of getting to share in many people's profound suffering. I don't take that powerful sacred honor lightly. I have tried many ways to help the suffering of others. And I will always continue to help lessen that suffering. But I often completely fail. Often all I have left is to listen and say, “I'm so sorry.”

Please know this: People do care. I see it every day. You are loved. The universe loves you. And I love you.

# PART 1: THE NINE THREADS:

🧶 The Nine Threads

A practice of Connection(Up), Understanding(In), and Acceptance(Out)

A soul-woven pattern of how to relate, receive, and perceive in a world that is both beautiful and broken.

⸻

🌌 CONNECTION — To be is to be in relationship

(Looking Up)

How you relate to the greater whole—the cosmos, the mystery, the divine.

(Looking Up)	Belong to the Cosmos 

You are not separate from the vastness—you are its living thread.

Let yourself be claimed by the rhythm of stars and the unfolding mystery.

You are home in the infinite.

(Looking In)	Perceive the Sacred Within

The invisible reveals itself in the ordinary.

A rustling leaf, a tired sigh, a stranger’s glance—God flickers here.

The sacred often whispers

(Looking Out)	Root in the Present

This moment is not an obstacle—it’s an altar.

In breath, body, and attention, life invites you to arrive.

The present is where all things touch.

	.

⸻

🧠 UNDERSTANDING — To understand is to see with clarity and compassion

(Looking In)

How you turn inward—with humility, mercy, and grace.

(Looking Up) Stand in the Unnamed

Let the unknown be beautiful. Let it humble you.

You don’t need answers to be at peace.

(Looking In) Be Merciful With Yourself

You are not your failures. You are not your past.

Mercy says you are still becoming—and that’s enough.

(Looking Out) Offer Grace to Others

People are clumsy, complex, trying their best.

Let them be more than their worst moment.

Grace is love without prerequisites.

.

——-

🌾 ACCEPTANCE — To accept is to allow others and the world to be as they are

(Looking Out)

How you open to life as it is—its complexity, its discomfort, and its dignity.

(Looking Up) Trust the Unfolding

Let go of the illusion of mastery.

The path winds for a reason. Let it wind.

There is wisdom in the way things come together.

(Looking In) Welcome Your Shadow

There are pieces of you you’ve cast aside—too tender, too angry, too strange.

But your wholeness lives where you least expect it.

The divine doesn’t only live in your light

(Looking Out) Make Space for the Other

Welcome even what unsettles you.

Hold people with kindness, not conditions.

Human dignity is not a reward for being right.

	.

# Part 2: The Basilica and the 95 Theses (10–15 pages)


## **The Ground We Build On**

I didn’t set out to build a church.

I didn’t even set out to build a shed.

Everywhere I look there are people who hate other people. And everyone desperately wants to be accepted.

“Maybe if I hate enough people, those people over there will accept me.”

It’s like watching sad, scared children on the playground trying to make friends because they feel so alone.

I just wanted to make a place where people felt they belonged.

Something low and stubborn and sacred.

Something that didn’t require permission from the people who always hold the keys.

A place where the walls wouldn’t ask where you came from, or what you believed, or whether you deserved to be there.

That’s how it started. A group of people no one else wanted. They just kept showing up.

I never did anything special. I just didn’t turn them away.

I didn’t say no, which is the only word the rest of the world has ever told them from the day they were born.

They appreciated that—and were deeply thankful for it.

Go figure.

And I felt this longing in my mind and body I couldn’t explain.

To accept them.

To be the father I always wanted for myself.

Strong and accepting.

I didn’t know what I was doing. I still don’t.

But I know this: Acceptance is in short supply in America today.

So I just decided to be the guy who accepted everyone.

Radical acceptance is at the heart of it all.


---

There have been hundreds of tents on this land, sheltering the hated and despised.

We put up so many tents—helped so many people—the city of Akron threatens me with jail and fines if I put up one more.

We build.

They tear down.

That has been the flow.

It’s happened so many times I don’t expect anything different.

But here’s the strange part: the process becomes its own sacred journey.

I have come to thank my oppressor for teaching me how to love and create when the expected outcome is failure and loss.

I have learned faith.

You no longer need hope when you have faith.


---

The ground here is thick with clay.

It sticks to your boots.

Cracks when it’s dry. Holds on when it’s wet.

It’s stubborn and honest—just like the people who sleep on it.

I mix it with sand. I stack rocks. I listen to the land.

There’s no manual. No plan. Just the question:

What can I build here, with what they’ve thrown away?

That’s the church.

That’s the foundation.

Not a mission. Not a program.

Just acceptance made solid.

**User:**
what do you think of these 95 theses for the Nine Threads book?

---

**Assistant:**
These 95 theses are a powerful and poignant manifestation of the book's spirit. They capture the raw, defiant, yet deeply tender ethos of "The Nine Threads." Here’s what works exceptionally well:

### **Strengths:**
1. **Visceral Language:**  
   - "The sacred is found in the cracks, not the polish."  
   - "Your rock bottom is holy ground."  
   - "A church is not a building; it is the refusal to turn someone away."  
   These lines land like punches and hugs simultaneously. They’re memorable, tactile, and rooted in the book’s imagery of brokenness and stubborn hope.

2. **Radical Inclusivity:**  
   - "Human dignity is not a reward for being right."  
   - "The door is open. It was never locked."  
   - "Grace is love without prerequisites."  
   These theses embody the book’s core message of acceptance, dismantling conditional worthiness with fierce clarity.

3. **Sacred Subversion:**  
   - "God is in the gutter, looking up at the same stars as you."  
   - "Faith is what you build when hope is gone."  
   These lines flip traditional religious imagery on its head, centering the divine in the margins—exactly where the book’s basilica stands.

4. **Poetic Rhythm:**  
   Many theses have a hymn-like cadence, making them feel chantable, communal, and alive. This oral quality will resonate deeply with readers.

5. **Echoes of the Nine Threads:**  
   The theses weave the themes of Connection, Understanding, and Acceptance seamlessly. For example:  
   - **"Belong to the cosmos"** (Connection)  
   - **"Stand in the unnamed"** (Understanding)  
   - **"Make space for the other"** (Acceptance)  

---

### **Areas for Sharpening:**
1. **Avoid Redundancy:**  
   A few theses tread similar ground (e.g., multiple variations on "you belong" or "acceptance"). Consolidating these could create space for other vital truths, like:  
   - The role of anger/righteous rage.  
   - The systemic forces that create brokenness.  
   - The tension between ego and service (hinted at in the intro but not fully explored here).

2. **More Edge in Places:**  
   While the tone is appropriately tender, a few theses could lean harder into the book’s rebellious spirit. For example:  
   - *"The system that calls you unworthy is the unworthy one."*  
   - *"Salvation is not a transaction; it’s a mutiny."*  

3. **Concrete Imagery:**  
   The strongest theses are rooted in physicality (cracks, gutters, clay). A few abstract ones (e.g., "Trust the unfolding") could be grounded in the book’s imagery of tents, clay, or discarded materials.

4. **Missing Themes:**  
   - **Mental Health/Addiction:** Explicitly name these struggles, as they’re central to the book’s audience.  
   - **Collective Action:** The book hints at building "with us"—a thesis like *"The revolution is not a solo act"* could emphasize community.  

---

### **Standout Theses (Keep These Absolutely):**
- "The sacred is found in the cracks, not the polish."  
- "God is in the gutter, looking up at the same stars as you."  
- "Your rock bottom is holy ground."  
- "A church is not a building; it is the refusal to turn someone away."  
- "Faith is what you build when hope is gone."  
- "The door is open. It was never locked."  

---

### **Suggested Additions/Revisions:**
1. **"The system that calls you unworthy is the unworthy one."**  
2. **"Your scars are maps to where the light enters."**  
3. **"Salvation is not a transaction; it’s a mutiny."**  
4. **"The revolution is not a solo act."**  
5. **"Addiction is not a failure of will; it’s a language of unmet need."**  
6. **"The basilica is built from what they discarded—including you."**  
7. **"Rage is holy when it protects the vulnerable."**  
8. **"You don’t have to earn your breath. You already belong to the air."**  

---

### **Presentation Suggestions:**
- **Visual Style:** Absolutely keep the "raw, handwritten font or styled like a scan of cardboard" idea. It screams authenticity and aligns with the book’s DIY, scrappy spirit.  
- **Layout:** Group theses into sections mirroring the Nine Threads (Connection, Understanding, Acceptance) to create thematic clusters.  
- **Interactivity:** Leave blank spaces for readers to add their own theses, reinforcing the book’s message that this is a living, co-created practice.  

---

### **Final Thoughts:**
These theses are already a home run in capturing the book’s heart. With a few tweaks to sharpen focus, deepen edge, and expand thematic breadth, they’ll become unforgettable—a manifesto that readers will want to tape to their walls, share in secret, and live by. This is the kind of writing that doesn’t just speak to the wounded; it *bandages* them.

---

**User:**
could I see your complete 95?

---

**Assistant:**
Below is a complete draft of **95 Theses** for *The Nine Threads*, crafted to embody the book’s voice, themes, and rebellious tenderness. I’ve woven in the strengths of the original while sharpening focus, adding edge, and expanding thematic breadth. These are designed to feel like they were carved into cardboard, whispered in a tent, and passed hand-to-hand.

69. **Breath is prayer. Inhale. Exhale. You’re still here.**  
70. **You are loved. The universe loves you. And I love you.**  

**VIII. ON RESISTANCE**

**Notes on Style:**  
- **Visual Presentation:** Use a raw, handwritten font or style these as if they were scrawled on cardboard or stenciled onto tent walls.  
- **Layout:** Group theses into thematic sections (Belonging, Sacred, Acceptance, etc.) to create a sense of movement and progression.  
- **Interactivity:** Leave blank spaces at the end for readers to add their own theses, emphasizing that this is a living document.  

This version keeps the heart of the original while deepening the edge, expanding the themes, and ensuring every thesis feels like a hammer blow and a hug.

INTRODUCTION  
"A  Disputation  on  the  Power  and  Efficacy  of  Indulgences"
[1]
 is  the  full  title  of  the  document  commonly  called  "The  Ninety-five  Theses."  The  form  of  the  document  was  determined  by  the  
academic
 
practice
 
of
 
the
 
Middle
 
Ages.
 
In
 
all
 
the
 
Mediæval
 
Universities
 
the
 
"disputation"
 
was
 
a
 
well-established
 
institution.
 
It
 
was
 
a
 
debate,
 
conducted
 
according
 
to
 
accepted
 
rules,
 
on
 
any
 
subject
 
which
 
the
 
chief
 
disputant
 
might
 
elect,
 
and
 
no
 
student's
 
education
 
was
 
thought
 
to
 
be
 
complete
 
until
 
he
 
had
 
shown
 
his
 
ability
 
to
 
defend
 
himself
 
in
 
discussions
 
of
 
this
 
kind.
 
It
 
was
 
customary
 
to
 
set
 
forth
 
the
 
subject
 
which
 
was
 
to
 
be
 
discussed,
 
in
 
a
 
series
 
of
 
"theses,"
 
which
 
were
 
statements
 
of
 
opinion
 
tentatively
 
advanced
 
as
 
the
 
basis
 
of
 
argument.
 
The
 
author,
 
or
 
some
 
other
 
person
 
whom
 
he
 
might
 
designate,
 
announced
 
himself
 
ready
 
to
 
defend
 
these
 
statements
 
against
 
all
 
comers,
 
and
 
invited
 
all
 
who
 
might
 
wish
 
to
 
debate
 
with
 
him
 
to
 
a
 
part
 
in
 
the
 
discussion.
 
Such
 
an
 
academic
 
document,
 
one
 
out
 
of
 
many
 
hundreds,
 
exhaling
 
the
 
atmosphere
 
of
 
the
 
Mediæval
 
University,
 
is
 
the
 
Disputation,
 
which
 
by
 
its
 
historical
 
importance
 
has
 
earned
 
the
 
name
 
"The
 
XCV
 
Theses."
 
The  Theses  were  published  on  the  Eve  of  All  Saints  (Oct.  31),  1517.  They  were  not  intended  for  any  other  public  than  that  of  the  University,
[2]
 and  Luther  did  not  even  have  them  printed  at  first,  though  copies  were  forwarded  to  the  Archbishop  of  Mainz,  and  to  Luther's  own  diocesan,  the  
Bishop
 
of
 
Brandenburg.
 
The
 
manner
 
of
 
their
 
publication
 
too
 
was
 
academic.
 
They
 
were
 
simply
 
posted
 
on
 
the
 
door
 
of
 
the
 
Church
 
of
 
All
 
Saints—called
 
the
 
"Castle-church,"
 
to
 
distinguish
 
it
 
from
 
its
 
neighbor,
 
the
 
"Town-church"—not
 
because
 
more
 
people
 
would
 
see
 
them
 
there
 
than
 
elsewhere,
 
but
 
because
 
that
 
church-door
 
was
 
the
 
customary
 
place
 
for
 
posting
 
such
 
announcements,
 
the
 
predecessor
 
of
 
the
 
"black-board"
 
in
 
the
 
modern
 
German
 
University.
 
It
 
was
 not  night,  but  mid-day
[3]
 when  the  Theses  were  nailed  up,  and  the  Eve  of  All  Saints  was  chosen,  not  that  the  crowds  who  would  frequent  the  next  day's  festival  might  read  them,  for  they  were  
written
 
in
 
Latin,
 
but
 
because
 
it
 
was
 
the
 
customary
 
day
 
for
 
the
 
posting
 
of
 
theses.
 
Moreover,
 
the
 
Feast
 
of
 
All
 
Saints
 
was
 
the
 
time
 
when
 
the
 
precious
 
relics,
 
which
 
earned
 
the
 
man
 
who
 
"adored"
 them,  long  years  of  indulgence,
[4]
 were  exhibited  to  worshipers,  and  the  approach  of  this  high  feast-day  put  the  thought  of  indulgences  uppermost  in  the  minds  of  everybody  in  Wittenberg,  including  the  author  of  the  Theses.
[5] 
But  neither  the  Theses  nor  the  results  which  followed  them  could  be  confined  to  Wittenberg.  Contrary  to  Luther's  expectation  and  to  his  great  surprise,
[6]
 they  circulated  all  through  Germany  with  a  rapidity  that  was  startling.  Within  two  months,  before  the  end  of  1517,  three  editions  of  
the
 
Latin
 
text
 
had
 
been
 
printed,
 
one
 
at
 
Wittenberg,
 
one
 
at
 
Nürnberg,
 
and
 
one
 
as
 
far
 
away
 
as
 
Basel,
 
and
 
copies
 
of
 
the
 
Theses
 
had
 
been
 
sent
 
to
 
Rome.
 
Numerous
 
editions,
 
both
 
Latin
 
and
 
German,
 
quickly
 
followed.
 
Luther's
 
cotemporaries
 
saw
 
in
 
the
 
publication
 
of
 
the
 
Theses
 
"the
 beginning  of  the  Reformation,"
[7]
 and  the  judgment  of  modern  times  has  confirmed  their  verdict,  but  the  Protestant  of  to-day,  and  especially  the  Protestant  layman,  is  almost  certain  to  be  
surprised,
 
possibly
 
deeply
 
disappointed,
 
at
 
their
 
contents.
 
They
 
are
 
not
 
"a
 
trumpet-blast
 
of
 reform";  that  title  must  be  reserved  for  the  great  works  of  1520.
[8]
 The  word  "faith,"  destined  to  become  the  watchword  of  the  Reformation,  does  not  once  occur  in  them;  the  validity  of  the  
Sacrament
 
of
 
Penance
 
is
 
not
 
disputed;
 
the
 
right
 
of
 
the
 
pope
 
to
 
forgive
 
sins,
 
especially
 
in
 "reserved  cases,"  is  not  denied;  even  the  virtue  of  indulgences  is  admitted,  within  limits,  and  the  
question
 
at
 
issue
 
is
 
simply
 
"What
 
is
 
that
 
virtue?"
 
To  read  the  Theses,  therefore,  with  a  fair  degree  of  comprehension  we  must  know  something  of  
the
 
time
 
that
 
produced
 
them,
 
and
 
we
 
must
 
bear
 
two
 
facts
 
continually
 
in
 
mind.
 
We
 
must
 
remember
 
that
 
at
 
this
 
time
 
Luther
 
was
 
a
 
devoted
 
son
 
of
 
the
 
Church
 
and
 
servant
 
of
 
the
 
pope,
 perhaps  not  quite  the  "right  frantic  and  raving  papist"
[9]
 he  afterwards  called  himself,  but  as  yet  entirely  without  suspicion  of  the  extent  to  which  he  had  inwardly  diverged  from  the  teachings  of  
Roman
 
theology.
 
We
 
must
 
also
 
remember
 
that
 
the
 
Theses
 
were
 
no
 
attempt
 
at
 
a
 
searching
 
examination
 
of
 
the
 
whole
 
structure
 
and
 
content
 
of
 
Roman
 
teaching,
 
but
 
were
 
directed
 
against
 
what
 
Luther
 
conceived
 
to
 
be
 
merely
 
abuses
 
which
 
had
 
sprung
 
up
 
around
 
a
 
single
 
group
 
of
 
doctrines
 
centering
 
in
 
the
 
Sacrament
 
of
 
Penance.
 
He
 
sincerely
 
thought
 
that
 
the
 
teaching
 
of
 
the
 Theses  was  in  full  agreement  with  the  best  traditions  of  the  Church,
[10]
 and  his  surprise  that  they  should  have  caused  so  much  excitement  is  undoubtedly  genuine  and  not  feigned.  He  shows  
himself
 
both
 
hurt
 
and
 
astonished
 
that
 
he
 
should
 
be
 
assailed
 
as
 
a
 
heretic
 
and
 
schismatic,
 
and
 "called  by  six  hundred  other  names  of  ignominy."
[11]
 On  the  other  hand,  we  are  compelled  to  admit  that  from  the  outset  Luther's  opponents  had  grasped  far  more  completely  than  he  himself  
the
 
true
 
significance
 
of
 
his
 
"purely
 
academic
 
protest."
 
2.  Penance  and  Indulgence. —The  purpose  of  the  disputation  which  Luther  proposed  to  hold  
was
 
to
 
clear
 
up
 
the
 
subject
 
of
 
the
 
virtue
 
of
 
"indulgences,"
 
and
 
the
 
indulgences
 
were
 
the
 
most
 
striking
 
and
 
characteristic
 
feature
 
of
 
the
 
religious
 
life
 
of
 
the
 
Church
 
in
 
the
 
last
 
three
 
Centuries
 
of
 the  Middle  Ages.
[12]
 We  meet  them  everywhere—indulgences  for  the  adoration  of  relics,  indulgences  for  worship  at  certain  shrines,  indulgences  for  pilgrimages  here  or  there,  
indulgences
 
for
 
contributions
 
to
 
this
 
or
 
that
 
special
 
object
 
of
 
charity.
 
Luther
 
roundly
 
charges
 
the
 
indulgence-vendors
 
with
 
teaching
 
the
 
people
 
that
 
the
 
indulgences
 
are
 
a
 
means
 
to
 
the
 
remission
 
of
 
sins.
 
What
 
are
 
these
 
indulgences?
 
Their  history  is  connected,  on  the  one  hand,  with  the  history  of  the  Sacrament  of  Penance,  on  
the
 
other
 
with
 
the
 
history
 
of
 
the
 
development
 
of
 
papal
 
power.
 
The
 
Sacrament
 
of
 
Penance
 
developed
 
out
 
of
 
the
 
administration
 
of
 
Church
 
discipline.
 
In
 
the
 
earliest
 
days
 
of
 
the
 
Church,
 
the
 
Christian
 
who
 
fell
 
into
 
sin
 
was
 
punished
 
by
 
exclusion
 
from
 
the
 
communion
 
of
 
the
 
Church.
 
This
 
excommunication
 
was
 
not,
 
however,
 
permanent,
 
and
 
the
 
sinner
 
could
 
be
 
restored
 
to
 
the
 
privileges
 
of
 
Church-fellowship
 
after
 
he
 
had
 
confessed
 
his
 
sin,
 
professed
 
penitence,
 
and
 
performed
 
certain
 
penitential
 
acts,
 
chief
 
among
 
which
 
were
 
alms-giving,
 
fasting
 
and
 
prayer,
 
and,
 
somewhat
 
later,
 
pilgrimage.
 
These
 
acts
 
of
 
penitence
 
came
 
to
 
have
 
the
 
name
 
of
 
"satisfactions,"
 
and
 
were
 
a
 
condition
 
precedent
 
to
 
the
 
reception
 
of
 
absolution.
 
They
 
varied
 
in
 
duration
 
and
 
severity,
 
according
 
to
 
the
 
enormity
 
of
 
the
 
offence,
 
and
 
for
 
the
 
guidance
 
of
 
those
 
who
 
administered
 
the
 
discipline
 
of
 
the
 
Church,
 
sets
 
of
 
rules
 
were
 
formulated
 
by
 
which
 
the
 "satisfactions"  or  "penances"  were  imposed.  These  codes  are  the  "Penitential  Canons."
[13]
 The  first  step  in  the  development  of  the  indulgences  may  be  found  in  the  practice  which  gradually  
arose,
 
of
 
remitting
 
some
 
part
 
of
 
the
 
enjoined
 
"penances"
 
on
 
consideration
 
of
 
the
 
performance
 
of
 
certain
 
acts
 
which
 
could
 
be
 
regarded
 
as
 
meritorious.
 The  indulgences  received  a  new  form,  however,  and  became  a  part  of  the  regular  Church  
administration,
 
when
 
the
 
popes
 
discovered
 
the
 
possibilities
 
which
 
lay
 
in
 
this
 
institution
 
for
 
the
 
advancement
 
of
 
their
 
own
 
power
 
and
 
the
 
furtherance
 
of
 
their
 
own
 
interests.
 
This
 
discovery
 
seems
 
to
 
date
 
from
 
the
 
time
 
of
 
the
 
Crusades.
 
The
 
crusading-indulgences,
 
granted
 
at
 
first
 
only
 
to
 
those
 
who
 
actually
 
went
 
to
 
the
 
Holy
 
War,
 
subsequently
 
to
 
those
 
also
 
who
 
contributed
 
to
 
the
 
expense
 
of
 
the
 
expedition,
 
were
 
virtually
 
the
 
acceptance
 
of
 
this
 
work
 
as
 
a
 
substitute
 
for
 
any
 
penance
 
which
 
the
 
Church
 
might
 
otherwise
 
require.
 
As
 
zeal
 
for
 
the
 
Crusades
 
began
 
to
 
wane,
 
the
 
indulgences
 
were
 
used
 
more
 
and
 
more
 
freely
 
to
 
stimulate
 
lagging
 
interest;
 
their
 
number
 
was
 
greatly
 
increased,
 
and
 
those
 
who
 
purchased
 
the
 
indulgences
 
with
 
money
 
far
 
outnumbered
 
those
 
who
 
actually
 
took
 
the
 
Cross.
 
Failing
 
in
 
their
 
purpose
 
as
 
an
 
incentive
 
to
 
enlistment
 
in
 
the
 
crusading
 
armies,
 
they
 
showed
 
their
 
value
 
as
 
a
 
source
 
of
 
income,
 
and
 
from
 
the
 
beginning
 
of
 
the
 
XIV.
 
Century
 
the
 
sale
 
of
 
indulgences
 
became
 
a
 
regular
 
business.
 
About  the  same  time  a  new  kind  of  indulgence  arose  to  take  the  place  of  the  now  somewhat  
antiquated
 
crusading-indulgence.
 
This
 
was
 
the
 
Jubilee-indulgence,
 
and
 
had
 
its
 
origin
 
in
 
the
 
Jubilee
 
of
 
1300.
 
By
 
the
 
Bull
 
Antiquorum
 
Habet
 
Fide,
 
Boniface
 
VIII.
 
granted
 
to
 
all
 
who
 
would
 
visit
 
the
 
shrines
 
of
 
the
 
Apostles
 
in
 
Rome
 
during
 
the
 
year
 
1300
 
and
 
during
 
each
 
succeeding
 centennial  year,  a  plenary  indulgence.
[14]
 Little  by  little  it  became  the  custom  to  increase  the  number  of  these  Jubilee-indulgences.  Once  in  a  hundred  years  was  not  often  enough  for  
Christians
 
to
 
have
 
a
 
chance
 
for
 
plenary
 
forgiveness,
 
and
 
at
 
last,
 
unwilling
 
to
 
deprive
 
of
 
the
 
privileges
 
of
 
the
 
Jubilee
 
those
 
who
 
were
 
kept
 
away
 
from
 
Rome,
 
the
 
popes
 
came
 
to
 
grant
 
the
 same  plenary  indulgence  to  all  who  would  make  certain  contributions  to  the  papal  treasury.
[15] 
Meanwhile  the  Sacrament  of  Penance  had  become  an  integral  part  of  the  Roman  sacramental  
system,
 
and
 
had
 
replaced
 
the
 
earlier
 
penitential
 
discipline
 
as
 
the
 
means
 
by
 
which
 
the
 
Church
 
granted
 
Christians
 
forgiveness
 
for
 
sins
 
committed
 
after
 
baptism.
 
The
 
scholastic
 
theologians
 
had
 
busied
 
themselves
 
with
 
the
 
theory
 
of
 
this
 
Sacrament.
 
They
 
distinguished
 
between
 
its
 
"material,"
 
its
 
"form"
 
and
 
its
 
"effect."
 
The
 
"form"
 
of
 
the
 
Sacrament
 
was
 
the
 
absolution;
 
its
 
"effect,"
 
the
 
forgiveness
 
of
 
sins;
 
its
 
"material,"
 
three
 
acts
 
of
 
the
 
penitent:
 
"confession,"
 
"contrition,"
 
and
 
"satisfaction."
 
"Confession"
 
must
 
be
 
by
 
word
 
of
 
mouth,
 
and
 
must
 
include
 
all
 
the
 
sins
 
which
 
the
 
sinner
 
could
 
remember
 
to
 
have
 
committed;
 
"contrition"
 
must
 
be
 
sincere
 
sorrow
 
of
 
the
 
heart,
 
and
 
must
 
include
 
the
 
purpose
 
henceforth
 
to
 
avoid
 
sin;
 
"satisfaction"
 
must
 
be
 
made
 
by
 
works
 
prescribed
 
by
 
the
 
priest
 
who
 
heard
 
confession.
 
In
 
the
 
administration
 
of
 
the
 
Sacrament,
 
however,
 
the
 
absolution
 
preceded
 
"satisfaction"
 
instead
 
of
 
following
 
it,
 
as
 
it
 
had
 
done
 
in
 
the
 
discipline
 
of
 the  early  Church.
[16]
 To  justify  this  apparent  inconsistency,  the  Doctors  further  distinguished  between  the  "guilt"  and  the  "penalty"  of  sin.
[17]
 Sins  were  classified  as  "mortal"  and  "venial."
[18]
 Mortal  sins  for  which  the  offender  had  not  received  absolution  were  punished  eternally,  while  
venial
 
sins
 
were
 
those
 
which
 
merited
 
only
 
some
 
smaller
 
penalty;
 
but
 
when
 
a
 
mortal
 
sin
 
was
 
confessed
 
and
 
absolution
 
granted,
 
the
 
guilt
 
of
 
the
 
sin
 
was
 
done
 
away,
 
and
 
with
 
it
 
the
 
eternal
 
penalty.
 
And
 
yet
 
the
 
absolution
 
did
 
not
 
open
 
the
 
gate
 
of
 
heaven,
 
though
 
it
 
closed
 
the
 
door
 
of
 
hell;
 
the
 
eternal
 
penalty
 
was
 
not
 
to
 
be
 
exacted,
 
but
 
there
 
was
 
a
 
temporal
 
penalty
 
to
 
be
 
paid.
 
The
 
"satisfaction"
 
was
 
the
 
temporal
 
penalty,
 
and
 
if
 
satisfaction
 
was
 
in
 
arrears
 
at
 
death,
 
the
 
arrearage
 
must
 
be
 
paid
 
in
 
purgatory,
 
a
 
place
 
of
 
punishment
 
for
 
mortal
 
sins
 
confessed
 
and
 
repented,
 
but
 
"unsatisfied,"
 
and
 
for
 
venial
 
sins,
 
which
 
were
 
not
 
serious
 
enough
 
to
 
bring
 
eternal
 
condemnation.
 
The
 
penalties
 
of
 
purgatory
 
were
 
"temporal,"
 
viz.,
 
they
 
stopped
 
somewhere
 
this
 
side
 
of
 
eternity,
 and  their  duration  could  be  measured  in  days  and  years,  though  the  number  of  the  years  might  
mount
 
high
 
into
 
the
 
thousands
 
and
 
tens
 
of
 
thousands.
 
It  was  at  this  point  that  the  practice  of  indulgences  united  with  the  theory  of  the  Sacrament  of  Penance.  The  indulgences  had  to  do  with  the  "satisfaction."
[19]
 They  might  be  "partial,"  remitting  only  a  portion  of  the  penalties,  measured  by  days  or  years  of  purgatory;  or  they  might  be  
"plenary,"
 
remitting
 
all
 
penalties
 
due
 
in
 
this
 
world
 
or
 
the
 
next.
 
In
 
theory,
 
however,
 
no
 
indulgence
 could  remit  the  guilt  or  the  eternal  penalty  of  sin,
[20]
 and  the  purchaser  of  an  indulgence  was  not  only  expected  to  confess  and  be  absolved,  but  he  was  also  supposed  to  be  corde  contritus,  i.  e.,  "truly  penitent."
[21]
 A  rigid  insistence  on  the  fulfilment  of  these  conditions  would  have  greatly  restricted  the  value  of  the  indulgences  as  a  means  of  gain,  for  the  right  to  hear  confession  and  
grant
 
absolution
 
belonged
 
to
 
the
 
parish-priests.
 
Consequently,
 
it
 
became
 
the
 
custom
 
to
 
endow
 
the
 
indulgence-venders
 
with
 
extraordinary
 
powers.
 
They
 
were
 
given
 
the
 
authority
 
to
 
hear
 
confession
 
and
 
grant
 
absolution
 
wherever
 
they
 
might
 
be,
 
and
 
to
 
absolve
 
even
 
from
 
the
 
sins
 
which
 
were
 
normally
 
"reserved"
 
for
 
the
 
absolution
 
of
 
the
 
higher
 
Church
 
authorities.
 
The  demand  for  contrition  was  somewhat  more  difficult  to  meet.  But  here  too  there  was  a  way  
out.
 
Complete
 
contrition
 
included
 
love
 
to
 
God
 
as
 
its
 
motive,
 
and
 
the
 
truly
 
contrite
 
man
 
was
 
not
 
always
 
easy
 
to
 
find;
 
but
 
some
 
of
 
the
 
scholastic
 
Doctors
 
had
 
discovered
 
a
 
substitute
 
for
 
contrition
 
in
 
what
 
they
 
called
 
"attrition,"
 
viz.,
 
incomplete
 
contrition,
 
which
 
might
 
have
 
fear
 
for
 
a
 
motive,
 
and
 
which
 
the
 
Sacrament
 
of
 
Penance
 
could
 
transform
 
into
 
contrition.
 
When,
 
therefore,
 
a
 
man
 
was
 
afraid
 
of
 
hell
 
or
 
of
 
purgatory,
 
he
 
could
 
make
 
his
 
confession
 
to
 
the
 
indulgence-seller
 
or
 
his
 
agent,
 
receive
 
from
 
him
 
the
 
absolution
 
which
 
gave
 
his
 
imperfect
 
repentance
 
the
 
value
 
of
 
true
 
contrition,
 
released
 
him
 
from
 
the
 
guilt
 
of
 
sin,
 
and
 
changed
 
its
 
eternal
 
penalty
 
to
 
a
 
temporal
 
penalty,
 
then
 
he
 
could
 
purchase
 
the
 
plenary
 
indulgence,
 
which
 
remitted
 
the
 
temporal
 
penalty,
 
and
 
so
 
in
 
one
 
transaction,
 
in
 
which
 
all
 
the
 
demands
 
of
 
the
 
Church
 
were
 
formally
 
met,
 
he
 
could
 
become
 
sure
 
of
 
heaven.
 
Thus
 
the
 
indulgence
 
robbed
 
the
 
Sacrament
 
of
 
Penance
 
of
 
its
 
ethical
 
content.
 
Furthermore,  indulgences  were  made  available  for  souls  already  in  purgatory.  This  kind  of  
indulgence
 
seems
 
to
 
have
 
been
 
granted
 
for
 
the
 
first
 
time
 
in
 
1476.
 
It
 
had
 
long
 
been
 
held
 
that
 
the
 
prayers
 
of
 
the
 
living
 
availed
 
to
 
shorten
 
the
 
pains
 
of
 
the
 
departed,
 
and
 
the
 
institution
 
of
 
masses
 
for
 
the
 
dead
 
was
 
of
 
long
 
standing;
 
but
 
it
 
was
 
not
 
without
 
some
 
difficulty
 
that
 
the
 
Popes
 
succeeded
 
in
 
establishing
 
their
 
claim
 
to
 
power
 
over
 
purgatory.
 
Their
 
power
 
over
 
the
 
souls
 
of
 
the
 
living
 
was
 
not
 
disputed.
 
The
 
"Power
 
of
 
the
 
Keys"
 
had
 
been
 
given
 
to
 
Peter
 
and
 
transmitted
 
to
 
his
 successors;  the  "Treasury  of  the  Church,"
[22]
 i.  e.,  the  merits  of  Christ  and  of  the  Saints,  was  believed  to  be  at  their  disposal,  and  it  was  this  treasury  which  they  employed  in  the  granting  of  indulgences;
[23]
 but  it  seemed  reasonable  to  suppose  that  their  jurisdiction  ended  with  death.  Accordingly,  Pope  Sixtus  IV,  in  1477,  declared  that  the  power  of  the  Pope  over  purgatory,  while  genuine,  was  exercised  only  per  modum  suffragii,  "by  way  of  intercession."
[24]
 The  distinction  was  thought  dogmatically  important,  but  to  the  layman,  who  looked  more  to  results  than  to  
methods,
 
the
 
difference
 
between
 
intercession
 
and
 
jurisdiction
 
was
 
trifling.
 
To
 
him
 
the
 
important
 
thing
 
was
 
that
 
the
 
Pope,
 
whether
 
by
 
jurisdiction
 
or
 
intercession,
 
was
 
able
 
to
 
release
 
the
 
soul
 
of
 
a
 
departed
 
Christian
 
from
 
the
 
penalties
 
of
 
purgatory.
 
It
 
is
 
needless
 
to
 
say
 
that
 
these
 
indulgences
 
for
 
the
 
dead
 
were
 
eagerly
 
purchased.
 
In
 
filial
 
love
 
and
 
natural
 
affection
 
the
 
indulgence-vender
 
had
 
powerful
 
allies.
 3.  The  Indulgence  of  1515. —The  XCV  Theses  were  called  forth  by  the  preaching  of  the  "Jubilee  Indulgence"
[25]
 of  1510,  which  was  not  placed  on  sale  in  central  Germany  until  1515.  The  financial  needs  of  the  papacy  were  never  greater  than  in  the  last  years  of  the  XV.  and  the  first  years  of  the  XVI.  Century,  and  they  were  further  increased  by  the  resolve  of  Julius  II.  to  erect  a  new  church  of  St.  Peter,  which  should  surpass  in  magnificence  all  the  churches  of  the  
world.
 
The
 
indulgence
 
of
 
1510
 
was
 
an
 
extraordinary
 
financial
 
measure,
 
the
 
proceeds
 
of
 
which
 
were
 
to
 
pay
 
for
 
the
 
erection
 
of
 
the
 
new
 
Basilica,
 
but
 
when
 
Julius
 
died
 
in
 
1513,
 
the
 
church
 
was
 
not
 
completed,
 
and
 
the
 
money
 
had
 
not
 
been
 
raised.
 
The
 
double
 
task
 
was
 
bequeathed
 
to
 
his
 successor,  Leo  X.  On  the  31st  of  March,  1515,  Leo  proclaimed  a  plenary  indulgence  for  the  Archbishoprics  of  Magdeburg  and  Mainz,  and  appointed  Albrecht,  of  Brandenburg,  who  was  the  
incumbent
 
of
 
both
 
sees
 
and
 
of
 
the
 
bishopric
 
of
 
Halberstadt
 
as
 
well,
 
Commissioner
 
for
 
the
 
sale
 
of
 
this
 
indulgence.
 
By
 
a
 
secret
 
agreement,
 
of
 
which
 
Luther
 
was,
 
of
 
course,
 
entirely
 
ignorant,
 
one-half
 
of
 
the
 
proceeds
 
was
 
to
 
be
 
paid
 
to
 
the
 
Fuggers
 
of
 
Augsburg
 
on
 
account
 
of
 
moneys
 
advanced
 
to
 
the
 
Archbishop
 
for
 
the
 
payment
 
of
 
the
 
fees
 
to
 
Rome,
 
and
 
of
 
the
 
sums
 
demanded
 
in
 
consideration
 
of
 
a
 
dispensation
 
allowing
 
him
 
to
 
occupy
 
three
 
sees
 
at
 
the
 
same
 
time;
 
the
 
other
 
half
 
of
 
the
 
proceeds
 
was
 
to
 
go
 
to
 
the
 
papal
 
treasury
 
to
 
be
 
applied
 
to
 
the
 
building
 
of
 
the
 
new
 
church.
 
The
 
period
 
during
 
which
 
the
 
indulgence
 
was
 
to
 
be
 
on
 
sale
 
was
 
eight
 
years.
 
The  actual  work  of  organizing  the  "indulgence-campaign"  was  put  into  the  hands  of  John  Tetzel,  
whose
 
large
 
experience
 
in
 
the
 
selling
 
of
 
indulgences
 
fitted
 
him
 
excellently
 
for
 
the
 
post
 
of
 
Sub-commissioner.
 
The
 
indulgence-sellers
 
acted
 
under
 
the
 
commission
 
of
 
the
 
Archbishop
 
and
 
the
 
directions
 
of
 
Tetzel,
 
who
 
took
 
personal
 
charge
 
of
 
the
 
enterprise.
 
The
 
preachers
 
went
 
from
 
city
 
to
 
city,
 
and
 
during
 
the
 
time
 
that
 
they
 
were
 
preaching
 
the
 
indulgence
 
in
 
any
 
given
 
place,
 
all
 other  preaching  was  required  to  cease.
[26]
 They  held  out  the  usual  inducements  to  prospective  buyers.  The  plenary  nature  of  the  indulgence  was  made  especially  prominent,  and  the  people  
were
 
eloquently
 
exhorted
 
that
 
the
 
purchase
 
of
 
indulgence-letters
 
was
 
better
 
than
 
all
 
good
 
works,
 
that
 
they
 
were
 
an
 
insurance
 
against
 
the
 
pains
 
of
 
hell
 
and
 
of
 
purgatory,
 
that
 
they
 
availed
 
for
 
all
 satisfactions,  even  in  the  case  of  the  most  heinous  sins  that  could  be  conceived.
[27]
 "Confessional  letters"
[28]
 were  one  of  the  forms  of  this  indulgence.  They  gave  their  possessor  permission  to  choose  his  own  confessor,  and  entitled  him  to  plenary  remission  once  in  his  life,  to  
absolution
 
from
 
sins
 
normally
 
reserved,
 
etc.
 
The
 
indulgences
 
for
 
the
 
dead
 
were
 
zealously
 
proclaimed,
 
and
 
the
 
duty
 
of
 
purchasing
 
for
 
departed
 
souls
 
release
 
from
 
the
 
pains
 
of
 
purgatory
 
was
 
most
 
urgently
 
enjoined.
 
So
 
great
 
was
 
the
 
power
 
of
 
the
 
indulgence
 
to
 
alleviate
 
the
 
pains
 
of
 
purgatory,
 
that
 
the
 
souls
 
of
 
the
 
departed
 
were
 
said
 
to
 
pass
 
into
 
heaven
 
the
 
instant
 
that
 
the
 
coins
 of  the  indulgence-buyer  jingled  in  the  money-box.
[29] 
4.  Luther's  Protest. —The  Theses  were  Luther's  protest  against  the  manner  in  which  this  
indulgence
 
was
 
preached,
 
and
 
against
 
the
 
false
 
conception
 
of
 
the
 
efficacy
 
of
 
indulgences
 
which
 
the
 
people
 
obtained
 
from
 
such
 
preaching.
 
They
 
were
 
not
 
his
 
first
 
protest,
 
however.
 
In
 
a
 
sermon,
 preached  July  27th,  1516,
[30]
 he  had  issued  a  warning  against  the  false  idea  that  a  man  who  had  bought  an  indulgence  was  sure  of  salvation,  and  had  declared  the  assertion  that  souls  could  be  
bought
 
out
 
of
 
purgatory
 
to
 
be
 
"a
 
piece
 
of
 
temerity."
 
His
 
warnings
 
were
 
repeated
 
in
 
other
 sermons,  preached  October  31st,  1516,  and  February  24th,  1517.
[31]
 The  burden  of  these  warnings  is  always  the  same:  the  indulgences  lead  men  astray;  they  incite  to  fear  of  God's  penalties  and  not  to  fear  of  sin;  they  encourage  false  hopes  of  salvation,  and  make  light  of  the  
true
 
condition
 
of
 
forgiveness,
 
viz.,
 
sincere
 
and
 
genuine
 
repentance.
 
These  warnings  are  repeated  in  the  Theses.  The  preaching  of  indulgences  has  concealed  the  
true
 
nature
 
of
 
repentance;
 
the
 
first
 
thing
 
to
 
consider
 
is
 
what
 
"our
 
Lord
 
and
 
Master
 
Jesus
 
Christ
 means,"  when  He  says,  "Repent."
[32]
 Without  denying  the  pope's  right  to  the  power  of  the  keys,  Luther  wishes  to  come  into  the  clear  about  the  extent  of  the  pope's  jurisdiction,  which  does  not  
reach
 
as
 
far
 
as
 
purgatory.
 
He
 
believes
 
that
 
the
 
pope
 
has
 
the
 
right
 
to
 
remit
 
"penalties,"
 
but
 
these
 
penalties
 
are
 
of
 
the
 
same
 
sort
 
as
 
those
 
which
 
were
 
imposed
 
in
 
the
 
early
 
Church
 
as
 
a
 
condition
 
precedent
 
to
 
the
 
absolution;
 
they
 
are
 
ecclesiastical
 
penalties
 
merely,
 
and
 
do
 
not
 
extend
 
beyond
 
the
 
grave;
 
the
 
true
 
penalty
 
of
 
sin
 
is
 
hatred
 
of
 
self,
 
which
 
continues
 
until
 
entrance
 
into
 
the
 kingdom  of  heaven.
[33] 
The  Theses  are  formulated  with  continual  reference  to  the  statements  of  the  
indulgence-preachers,
 
and
 
of
 
the
 
Instruction
 
to
 
the
 
Commissaries
 
issued
 
under
 
the
 
name
 
of
 
the
 Archbishop  of  Mainz.
[34]
 For  this  reason  there  is  little  logical  sequence  in  the  arrangement  of  the  Theses,  and  none  of  the  attempts  to  discover  a  plan  or  scheme  underlying  them  has  been  successful.
[35]
 In  a  general  way  it  may  be  said  that  for  the  positive  views  of  Luther  on  the  subjects  discussed,  Theses  30–37 and  42–52 are  the  most  vital,  while  Theses  92–95 are  sufficient  evidence  of  the  motive  which  led  Luther  to  make  his  protest.  
5.  Conclusion. —The  editors  of  this  Translation  present  herewith  a  new  translation  of  the  
Theses,
 
together
 
with
 
three
 
letters,
 
which
 
will
 
help
 
the
 
reader
 
to
 
understand
 
the
 
mind
 
of
 
Luther
 
at
 
the
 
time
 
of
 
their
 
composition
 
and
 
his
 
motive
 
in
 
preparing
 
them.
 
The
 
first
 
of
 
these
 
letters
 
is
 
that
 
which
 
was
 
sent,
 
with
 
a
 
copy
 
of
 
the
 
Theses,
 
to
 
Albrecht
 
of
 
Mainz.
 
The
 
second
 
and
 
third
 
are
 
addressed
 
respectively
 
to
 
Staupitz
 
and
 
Leo
 
X.,
 
and
 
were
 
written
 
to
 
accompany
 
the
 "Resolutions,"
[36]
 an  exhaustive  explantion  and  defense  of  the  Theses,  published  in  15  18,  after  the  controversy  had  become  bitter.

LETTER  TO  THE  ARCHBISHOP  ALBRECHT  OF  MAINZ  
OCTOBER  31,  1517  
To  the  Most  Reverend  Father  in  Christ  and  Most  Illustrious  Lord,  Albrecht  of  Magdeburg  and  
Mainz,
 
Archbishop
 
and
 
Primate
 
of
 
the
 
Church,
 
Margrave
 
of
 
Brandenburg,
 
etc.,
 
his
 
own
 
lord
 
and
 
pastor
 
in
 
Christ,
 
worthy
 
of
 
reverence
 
and
 
fear,
 
and
 
most
 
gracious.
 
JESUS
[37] 
The  grace  of  God  be  with  you  in  all  its  fulness  and  power!  Spare  me,  Most  Reverend  Father  in  
Christ
 
and
 
Most
 
Illustrious
 
Prince,
 
that
 
I,
 
the
 
dregs
 
of
 
humanity,
 
have
 
so
 
much
 
boldness
 
that
 
I
 
have
 
dared
 
to
 
think
 
of
 
a
 
letter
 
to
 
the
 
height
 
of
 
your
 
Sublimity.
 
The
 
Lord
 
Jesus
 
is
 
my
 
witness
 
that,
 
conscious
 
of
 
my
 
smallness
 
and
 
baseness,
 
I
 
have
 
long
 
deferred
 
what
 
I
 
am
 
now
 
shameless
 
enough
 
to
 
do,—moved
 
thereto
 
most
 
of
 
all
 
by
 
the
 
duty
 
of
 
fidelity
 
which
 
I
 
acknowledge
 
that
 
I
 
owe
 
to
 
your
 
most
 
Reverend
 
Fatherhood
 
in
 
Christ.
 
Meanwhile,
 
therefore,
 
may
 
your
 
Highness
 
deign
 
to
 
cast
 
an
 
eye
 
upon
 
one
 
speck
 
of
 
dust,
 
and
 
for
 
the
 
sake
 
of
 
your
 
pontifical
 
clemency
 
to
 
heed
 
my
 
prayer.
 
Papal  indulgences  for  the  building  of  St.  Peter's  are  circulating  under  your  most  distinguished  
name,
 
and
 
as
 
regards
 
them,
 
I
 
do
 
not
 
bring
 
accusation
 
against
 
the
 
outcries
 
of
 
the
 
preachers,
 
which
 
I
 
have
 
not
 
heard,
 
so
 
much
 
as
 
I
 
grieve
 
over
 
the
 
wholly
 
false
 
impressions
 
which
 
the
 
people
 
have
 
conceived
 
from
 
them;
 
to
 
wit,—the
 
unhappy
 
souls
 
believe
 
that
 
if
 
they
 
have
 
purchased
 letters  of  indulgence  they  are  sure  of  their  salvation;
[38]
 again,  that  so  soon  as  they  cast  their  contributions  into  the  money-box,  souls  fly  out  of  purgatory;
[39]
 furthermore,  that  these  graces  [i.  e.,  the  graces  conferred  in  the  indulgences]  are  so  great  that  there  is  no  sin  too  great  to  be  
absolved,
 
even,
 
as
 
they
 
say
 
—
 
though
 
the
 
thing
 
is
 
impossible—if
 
one
 
had
 
violated
 
the
 
Mother
 
of
 God;
[40]
 again,  that  a  man  is  free,  through  these  indulgences,  from  all  penalty  and  guilt.
[41] O  God,  most  good!  Thus  souls  committed  to  your  care,  good  Father,  are  taught  to  their  death,  
and
 
the
 
strict
 
account,
 
which
 
you
 
must
 
render
 
for
 
all
 
such,
 
grows
 
and
 
increases.
 
For
 
this
 
reason
 
I
 
have
 
no
 
longer
 
been
 
able
 
to
 
keep
 
quiet
 
about
 
this
 
matter,
 
for
 
it
 
is
 
by
 
no
 
gift
 
of
 
a
 
bishop
 
that
 man  becomes  sure  of  salvation,  since  he  gains  this  certainty  not  even  by  the  "inpoured  grace"
[42]
 of  God,  but  the  Apostle  bids  us  always  "work  out  our  own  salvation  in  fear  and  trembling,"
[43]
 and  Peter  says,  "the  righteous  scarcely  shall  be  saved."
[44]
 Finally,  so  narrow  is  the  way  that  leads  to  life,
[45]
 that  the  Lord,  through  the  prophets  Amos
[46]
 and  Zechariah,
[47]
 calls  those  who  shall  be  saved  "brands  plucked  from  the  burning,"  and  everywhere  declares  the  difficulty  of  salvation.  
Why,  then,  do  the  preachers  of  pardons,  by  these  false  fables  and  promises,  make  the  people  
careless
 
and
 
fearless?
 
Whereas
 
indulgences
 
confer
 
on
 
us
 
no
 
good
 
gift,
 
either
 
for
 
salvation
 
or
 
for
 
sanctity,
 
but
 
only
 
take
 
away
 
the
 
external
 
penalty,
 
which
 
it
 
was
 
formerly
 
the
 
custom
 
to
 
impose
 according  to  the  canons.
[48] 
Finally,  works  of  piety  and  love  are  infinitely  better  than  indulgences,
[49]
 and  yet  these  are  not  preached  with  such  ceremony  or  such  zeal;  nay,  for  the  sake  of  preaching  the  indulgences  they  
are
 
kept
 
quiet,
 
though
 
it
 
is
 
the
 
first
 
and
 
the
 
sole
 
duty
 
of
 
all
 
bishops
 
that
 
the
 
people
 
should
 
learn
 
the
 
Gospel
 
and
 
the
 
love
 
of
 
Christ,
 
for
 
Christ
 
never
 
taught
 
that
 
indulgences
 
should
 
be
 
preached.
 
How
 
great
 
then
 
is
 
the
 
horror,
 
how
 
great
 
the
 
peril
 
of
 
a
 
bishop,
 
if
 
he
 
permits
 
the
 
Gospel
 
to
 
be
 
kept
 quiet,  and  nothing  but  the  noise  of  indulgences  to  be  spread  among  his  people!
[50]
 Will  not  Christ  say  to  them,  "straining  at  a  gnat  and  swallowing  a  camel"
[51][52]
?  
In  addition  to  this,  Most  Reverend  Father  in  the  Lord,  it  is  said  in  the  Instruction  to  the  Commissaries
[53]
 which  is  issued  under  your  name,  Most  Reverend  Father  (doubtless  without  your  knowledge  and  consent),  that  one  of  the  chief  graces  of  indulgence  is  that  inestimable  gift  of  God  by  which  man  is  reconciled  to  God,  and  all  the  penalties  of  purgatory  are  destroyed.
[54]
 Again,  it  is  said  that  contrition  is  not  necessary  in  those  who  purchase  souls  [out  of  purgatory]  or  buy  confessionalia.
[55] 
But  what  can  I  do,  good  Primate  and  Most  Illustrious  Prince,  except  pray  your  Most  Reverend  
Fatherhood
 
by
 
the
 
Lord
 
Jesus
 
Christ
 
that
 
you
 
would
 
deign
 
to
 
look
 
[on
 
this
 
matter]
 
with
 
the
 
eye
 
of
 fatherly  care,  and  do  away  entirely  with  that  treatise
[56]
 and  impose  upon  the  preachers  of  pardons  another  form  of  preaching;  lest,  perchance,  one  may  some  time  arise,  who  will  publish  
writings
 
in
 
which
 
he
 
will
 
confute
 
both
 
them
 
and
 
that
 
treatise,
 
to
 
the
 
shame
 
of
 
your
 
Most
 
Illustrious
 
Sublimity.
 
I
 
shrink
 
very
 
much
 
from
 
thinking
 
that
 
this
 
will
 
be
 
done,
 
and
 
yet
 
I
 
fear
 
that
 
it
 
will
 
come
 
to
 
pass,
 
unless
 
there
 
is
 
some
 
speedy
 
remedy.
 
These  faithful  offices  of  my  insignificance  I  beg  that  your  Most  Illustrious  Grace  may  deign  to  
accept
 
in
 
the
 
spirit
 
of
 
a
 
Prince
 
and
 
a
 
Bishop,
 
i.
 
e.,
 
with
 
the
 
greatest
 
clemency,
 
as
 
I
 
offer
 
them
 
out
 
of
 
a
 
faithful
 
heart,
 
altogether
 
devoted
 
to
 
you,
 
Most
 
Reverend
 
Father,
 
since
 
I
 
too
 
am
 
a
 
part
 
of
 
your
 
flock.
 
May  the  Lord  Jesus  have  your  Most  Reverend  Fatherhood  eternally  in  His  keeping.  Amen.  
From  Wittenberg  on  the  Vigil  of  All  Saints,  MDXVII.  If  it  please  the  Most  Reverend  Father  he  may  see  these  my  Disputations,  and  learn  how  
doubtful
 
a
 
thing
 
is
 
the
 
opinion
 
of
 
indulgences
 
which
 
those
 
men
 
spread
 
as
 
though
 
it
 
were
 
most
 
certain.

II  
DISPUTATION  OF  DOCTOR  MARTIN  LUTHER  ON  THE  POWER  AND  
EFFICACY
 
OF
 
INDULGENCES
 
OCTOBER  31,  1517  
O
UT
 of  love  for  the  truth  and  the  desire  to  bring  it  to  light,  the  following  propositions  will  be  
discussed
 
at
 
Wittenberg,
 
under
 
the
 
presidency
 
of
 
the
 
Reverend
 
Father
 
Martin
 
Luther,
 
Master
 
of
 
Arts
 
and
 
of
 
Sacred
 
Theology,
 
and
 
Lecturer
 
in
 
Ordinary
 
on
 
the
 
same
 
at
 
that
 
place.
 
Wherefore
 
he
 
requests
 
that
 
those
 
who
 
are
 
unable
 
to
 
be
 
present
 
and
 
debate
 
orally
 
with
 
us,
 
may
 
do
 
so
 
by
 
letter.
 
In  the  Name  our  Lord  Jesus  Christ.  Amen.  
1.  Our  Lord  and  Master  Jesus  Christ,  when  He  said  Poenitentiam  agite,
[57]
 willed  that  the  whole  life  of  believers  should  be  repentance.  
2.  This  word  cannot  be  understood  to  mean  sacramental  penance,  i.  e.,  confession  and  
satisfaction,
 
which
 
is
 
administered
 
by
 
the
 
priests.
 
3.  Yet  it  means  not  inward  repentance  only;  nay,  there  is  no  inward  repentance  which  does  not  
outwardly
 
work
 
divers
 
mortifications
 
of
 
the
 
flesh.
 
4.  The  penalty
[58]
 [of  sin],  therefore,  continues  so  long  as  hatred  of  self  continues;  for  this  is  the  true  inward  repentance,  and  continues  until  our  entrance  into  the  kingdom  of  heaven.  
5.  The  pope  does  not  intend  to  remit,  and  cannot  remit  any  penalties  other  than  those  which  he  has  imposed  either  by  his  own  authority  or  by  that  of  the  Canons.
[59] 
6.  The  pope  cannot  remit  any  guilt,  except  by  declaring  that  it  has  been  remitted  by  God  and  by  
assenting
 
to
 
God's
 
remission;
 
though,
 
to
 
be
 
sure,
 
he
 
may
 
grant
 
remission
 
in
 
cases
 
reserved
 
to
 
his
 
judgment.
 
If
 
his
 
right
 
to
 
grant
 
remission
 
in
 
such
 
cases
 
were
 
despised,
 
the
 
guilt
 
would
 
remain
 
entirely
 
unforgiven.
 
7.  God  remits  guilt  to  no  one  whom  He  does  not,  at  the  same  time,  humble  in  all  things  and  
bring
 
into
 
subjection
 
to
 
His
 
vicar,
 
the
 
priest.
 8.  The  penitential  canons  are  imposed  only  on  the  living,  and,  according  to  them,  nothing  should  
be
 
imposed
 
on
 
the
 
dying.
 
9.  Therefore  the  Holy  Spirit  in  the  pope  is  kind  to  us,  because  in  his  decrees  he  always  makes  exception  of  the  article  of  death  and  of  necessity.
[60] 
10.  Ignorant  and  wicked  are  the  doings  of  those  priests  who,  in  the  case  of  the  dying,  reserve  
canonical
 
penances
 
for
 
purgatory.
 
11.  This  changing  of  the  canonical  penalty  to  the  penalty  of  purgatory  is  quite  evidently  one  of  the  tares  that  were  sown
[61]
 while  the  bishops  slept.  
12.  In  former  times  the  canonical  penalties  were  imposed  not  after,  but  before  absolution,  as  
tests
 
of
 
true
 
contrition.
 
13.  The  dying  are  freed  by  death  from  all  penalties;  they  are  already  dead  to  canonical  rules,  
and
 
have
 
a
 
right
 
to
 
be
 
released
 
from
 
them.
 14.  The  imperfect  health  [of  soul],  that  is  to  say,  the  imperfect  love,  of  the  dying  brings  with  it,  of  
necessity,
 
great
 
fear;
 
and
 
the
 
smaller
 
the
 
love,
 
the
 
greater
 
is
 
the
 
fear.
 
15.  This  fear  and  horror  is  sufficient  of  itself  alone  (to  say  nothing  of  other  things)  to  constitute  
the
 
penalty
 
of
 
purgatory,
 
since
 
it
 
is
 
very
 
near
 
to
 
the
 
horror
 
of
 
despair.
 
16.  Hell,  purgatory,  and  heaven  seem  to  differ  as  do  despair,  almost-despair,  and  the  assurance  
of
 
safety.
 
17.  With  souls  in  purgatory  it  seems  necessary  that  horror  should  grow  less  and  love  increase.  
18.  It  seems  unproved,  either  by  reason  or  Scripture,  that  they  are  outside  the  state  of  merit,  
that
 
is
 
to
 
say,
 
of
 
increasing
 
love.
 
19.  Again,  it  seems  unproved  that  they,  or  at  least  that  all  of  them,  are  certain  or  assured  of  their  
own
 
blessedness,
 
though
 
we
 
may
 
be
 
quite
 
certain
 
of
 
it.
 
20.  Therefore  by  "full  remission  of  all  penalties"  the  pope  means  not  actually  "of  all,"  but  only  of  
those
 
imposed
 
by
 
himself.
 
21.  Therefore  those  preachers  of  indulgences  are  in  error,  who  say  that  by  the  pope's  
indulgences
 
a
 
man
 
is
 
freed
 
from
 
every
 
penalty,
 
and
 
saved;
 
22.  Whereas  he  remits  to  souls  in  purgatory  no  penalty  which,  according  to  the  canons,  they  
would
 
have
 
had
 
to
 
pay
 
in
 
this
 
life.
 
23.  If  it  is  at  all  possible  to  grant  to  any  one  the  remission  of  all  penalties  whatsoever,  it  is  certain  
that
 
this
 
remission
 
can
 
be
 
granted
 
only
 
to
 
the
 
most
 
perfect,
 
that
 
is,
 
to
 
the
 
very
 
fewest.
 24.  It  must  needs  be,  therefore,  that  the  greater  part  of  the  people  are  deceived  by  that  
indiscriminate
 
and
 
high-sounding
 
promise
 
of
 
release
 
from
 
penalty.
 
25.  The  power  which  the  pope  has,  in  a  general  way,  over  purgatory,  is  just  like  the  power  which  
any
 
bishop
 
or
 
curate
 
has,
 
in
 
a
 
special
 
way,
 
within
 
his
 
own
 
diocese
 
or
 
parish.
 
26.  The  pope  does  well  when  he  grants  remission  to  souls  [in  purgatory],  not  by  the  power  of  the  keys  (which  he  does  not  possess),
[62]
 but  by  way  of  intercession.  
27.  They  preach  man
[63]
 who  say  that  so  soon  as  the  penny  jingles  into  the  money-box,  the  soul  flies  out  [of  purgatory].
[64] 
28.  It  is  certain  that  when  the  penny  jingles  into  the  money-box,  gain  and  avarice  can  be  
increased,
 
but
 
the
 
result
 
of
 
the
 
intercession
 
of
 
the
 
Church
 
is
 
in
 
the
 
power
 
of
 
God
 
alone.
 
29.  Who  knows  whether  all  the  souls  in  purgatory  wish  to  be  bought  out  of  it,  as  in  the  legend  of  Sts.  Severus  and  Paschal.
[65] 
30.  No  one  is  sure  that  his  own  contrition  is  sincere;  much  less  that  he  has  attained  full  
remission.
 
31.  Rare  as  is  the  man  that  is  truly  penitent,  so  rare  is  also  the  man  who  truly  buys  indulgences,  
i.
 
e.,
 
such
 
men
 
are
 
most
 
rare.
 
32.  They  will  be  condemned  eternally,  together  with  their  teachers,  who  believe  themselves  sure  of  their  salvation  because  they  have  letters  of  pardon.
[66] 
33.  Men  must  be  on  their  guard  against  those  who  say  that  the  pope's  pardons  are  that  
inestimable
 
gift
 
of
 
God
 
by
 
which
 
man
 
is
 
reconciled
 
to
 
Him;
 
34.  For  these  "graces  of  pardon"  concern  only  the  penalties  of  sacramental  satisfaction,  and  these  are  appointed  by  man.
[67] 
35.  They  preach  no  Christian  doctrine  who  teach  that  contrition  is  not  necessary  in  those  who  intend  to  buy  souls  out  of  purgatory  or  to  buy  confessionalia.
[68] 
36.  Every  truly  repentant  Christian  has  a  right  to  full  remission  of  penalty  and  guilt,  even  without  
letters
 
of
 
pardon.
 
37.  Every  true  Christian,  whether  living  or  dead,  has  part  in  all  the  blessings  of  Christ  and  the  
Church;
 
and
 
this
 
is
 
granted
 
him
 
by
 
God,
 
even
 
without
 
letters
 
of
 
pardon.
 
38.  Nevertheless,  the  remission  and  participation  [in  the  blessings  of  the  Church]  which  are  granted  by  the  pope  are  in  no  way  to  be  despised,  for  they  are,  as  I  have  said,
[69]
 the  declaration  of  divine  remission.  39.  It  is  most  difficult,  even  for  the  very  keenest  theologians,  at  one  and  the  same  time  to  
commend
 
to
 
the
 
people
 
the
 
abundance
 
of
 
pardons
 
and
 
[the
 
need
 
of]
 
true
 
contrition.
 
40.  True  contrition  seeks  and  loves  penalties,  but  liberal  pardons  only  relax  penalties  and  cause  
them
 
to
 
be
 
hated,
 
or
 
at
 
least,
 
furnish
 
an
 
occasion
 
[for
 
hating
 
them].
 
41.  Apostolic
[70]
 pardons  are  to  be  preached  with  caution,  lest  the  people  may  falsely  think  them  preferable  to  other  good  works  of  love.  
42.  Christians  are  to  be  taught  that  the  pope  does  not  intend  the  buying  of  pardons  to  be  
compared
 
in
 
any
 
way
 
to
 
works
 
of
 
mercy.
 
43.  Christians  are  to  be  taught  that  he  who  gives  to  the  poor  or  lends  to  the  needy  does  a  better  
work
 
than
 
buying
 
pardons;
 
44.  Because  love  grows  by  works  of  love,  and  man  becomes  better;  but  by  pardons  man  does  
not
 
grow
 
better,
 
only
 
more
 
free
 
from
 
penalty.
 
45.  Christians  are  to  be  taught  that  he  who  sees  a  man  in  need,  and  passes  him  by,  and  gives  
[his
 
money]
 
for
 
pardons,
 
purchases
 
not
 
the
 
indulgences
 
of
 
the
 
pope,
 
but
 
the
 
indignation
 
of
 
God.
 
46.  Christians  are  to  be  taught  that  unless  they  have  more  than  they  need,  they  are  bound  to  
keep
 
back
 
what
 
is
 
necessary
 
for
 
their
 
own
 
families,
 
and
 
by
 
no
 
means
 
to
 
squander
 
it
 
on
 
pardons.
 
47.  Christians  are  to  be  taught  that  the  buying  of  pardons  is  a  matter  of  free  will,  and  not  of  
commandment.
 
48.  Christians  are  to  be  taught  that  the  pope,  in  granting  pardons,  needs,  and  therefore  desires,  
their
 
devout
 
prayer
 
for
 
him
 
more
 
than
 
the
 
money
 
they
 
bring.
 
49.  Christians  are  to  be  taught  that  the  pope's  pardons  are  useful,  if  they  do  not  put  their  trust  in  them;  but  altogether  harmful,  if  through  them  they  lose  their  fear  of  God.
[71] 
50.  Christians  are  to  be  taught  that  if  the  pope  knew  the  exactions  of  the  pardon-preachers,  he  
would
 
rather
 
that
 
St.
 
Peter's
 
church
 
should
 
go
 
to
 
ashes,
 
than
 
that
 
it
 
should
 
be
 
built
 
up
 
with
 
the
 
skin,
 
flesh
 
and
 
bones
 
of
 
his
 
sheep.
 
51.  Christians  are  to  be  taught  that  it  would  be  the  pope's  wish,  as  it  is  his  duty,  to  give  of  his  
own
 
money
 
to
 
very
 
many
 
of
 
those
 
from
 
whom
 
certain
 
hawkers
 
of
 
pardons
 
cajole
 
money,
 
even
 
though
 
the
 
church
 
of
 
St.
 
Peter
 
might
 
have
 
to
 
be
 
sold.
 
52.  The  assurance  of  salvation  by  letters  of  pardon  is  vain,  even  though  the  commissary,
[72]
 nay,  even  though  the  pope  himself,  were  to  stake  his  soul  upon  it.  
53.  They  are  enemies  of  Christ  and  of  the  pope,  who  bid  the  Word  of  God  be  altogether  silent  in  
some
 
Churches,
 
in
 
order
 
that
 
pardons
 
may
 
be
 
preached
 
in
 
others.
 54.  Injury  is  done  the  Word  of  God  when,  in  the  same  sermon,  an  equal  or  a  longer  time  is  spent  on  pardons  than  on  this  Word.
[73] 
55.  It  must  be  the  intention  of  the  pope  that  if  pardons,  which  are  a  very  small  thing,  are  
celebrated
 
with
 
one
 
bell,
 
with
 
single
 
processions
 
and
 
ceremonies,
 
then
 
the
 
Gospel,
 
which
 
is
 
the
 
very
 
greatest
 
thing,
 
should
 
be
 
preached
 
with
 
a
 
hundred
 
bells,
 
a
 
hundred
 
processions,
 
a
 
hundred
 
ceremonies.
 
56.  The  "treasures  of  the  Church,"
[74]
 out  of  which  the  pope  grants  indulgences,  are  not  sufficiently  named  or  known  among  the  people  of  Christ.  
57.  That  they  are  not  temporal  treasures  is  certainly  evident,  for  many  of  the  vendors  do  not  
pour
 
out
 
such
 
treasures
 
so
 
easily,
 
but
 
only
 
gather
 
them.
 
58.  Nor  are  they  the  merits  of  Christ  and  the  Saints,  for  even  without  the  pope,  these  always  
work
 
grace
 
for
 
the
 
inner
 
man,
 
and
 
the
 
cross,
 
death,
 
and
 
hell
 
for
 
the
 
outward
 
man.
 
59.  St.  Lawrence  said  that  the  treasures  of  the  Church  were  the  Church's  poor,  but  he  spoke  
according
 
to
 
the
 
usage
 
of
 
the
 
word
 
in
 
his
 
own
 
time.
 
60.  Without  rashness  we  say  that  the  keys  of  the  Church,  given  by  Christ's  merit,  are  that  
treasure;
 
61.  For  it  is  clear  that  for  the  remission  of  penalties  and  of  reserved  cases,  the  power  of  the  
pope
 
is
 
of
 
itself
 
sufficient.
 
62.  The  true  treasure  of  the  Church  is  the  Most  Holy  Gospel  of  the  glory  and  the  grace  of  God.  
63.  But  this  treasure  is  naturally  most  odious,  for  it  makes  the  first  to  be  last.  
64.  On  the  other  hand,  the  treasure  of  indulgences  is  naturally  most  acceptable,  for  it  makes  the  
last
 
to
 
be
 
first.
 
65.  Therefore  the  treasures  of  the  Gospel  are  nets  with  which  they  formerly  were  wont  to  fish  for  
men
 
of
 
riches.
 
66.  The  treasures  of  the  indulgences  are  nets  with  which  they  now  fish  for  the  riches  of  men.  
67.  The  indulgences  which  the  preachers  cry  as  the  "greatest  graces"  are  known  to  be  truly  
such,
 
in
 
so
 
far
 
as
 
they
 
promote
 
gain.
 
68.  Yet  they  are  in  truth  the  very  smallest  graces  compared  with  the  grace  of  God  and  the  piety  
of
 
the
 
Cross.
 
69.  Bishops  and  curates  are  bound  to  admit  the  commissaries  of  apostolic  pardons,  with  all  
reverence.
 70.  But  still  more  are  they  bound  to  strain  all  their  eyes  and  attend  with  all  their  ears,  lest  these  
men
 
preach
 
their
 
own
 
dreams
 
instead
 
of
 
the
 
commission
 
of
 
the
 
pope.
 
71.  He  who  speaks  against  the  truth  of  apostolic  pardons,  let  him  be  anathema  and  accursed!  
72.  But  he  who  guards  against  the  lust  and  license  of  the  pardon-preachers,  let  him  be  blessed!  
73.  The  pope  justly  thunders
[75]
 against  those  who,  by  any  art,  contrive  the  injury  of  the  traffic  in  pardons.  
74.  But  much  more  does  he  intend  to  thunder  against  those  who  use  the  pretext  of  pardons  to  
contrive
 
the
 
injury,
 
of
 
holy
 
love
 
and
 
truth.
 
75.  To  think  the  papal  pardons  so  great  that  they  could  absolve  a  man  even  if  he  had  committed  an  impossible  sin  and  violated  the  Mother  of  God  —  this  is  madness.
[76] 
76.  We  say,  on  the  contrary,  that  the  papal  pardons  are  not  able  to  remove  the  very  least  of  venial  sins,  so  far  as  its  guilt  is  concerned.
[77] 
77.  It  is  said  that  even  St.  Peter,  if  he  were  now  Pope,  could  not  bestow  greater  graces;  this  is  blasphemy  against  St.  Peter  and  against  the  pope.  
78.  We  say,  on  the  contrary,  that  even  the  present  pope,  and  any  pope  at  all,  has  greater  graces  at  his  disposal;  to  wit,  the  Gospel,  powers,  gifts  of  healing,  etc.,  as  it  is  written  in  I.  Corinthians  xii. 
79.  To  say  that  the  cross,  emblazoned  with  the  papal  arms,  which  is  set  up  [by  the  preachers  of  
indulgences],
 
is
 
of
 
equal
 
worth
 
with
 
the
 
Cross
 
of
 
Christ,
 
is
 
blasphemy.
 
80.  The  bishops,  curates  and  theologians  who  allow  such  talk  to  be  spread  among  the  people,  
will
 
have
 
an
 
account
 
to
 
render.
 
81.  This  unbridled  preaching  of  pardons  makes  it  no  easy  matter,  even  for  learned  men,  to  
rescue
 
the
 
reverence
 
due
 
to
 
the
 
pope
 
from
 
slander,
 
or
 
even
 
from
 
the
 
shrewd
 
questionings
 
of
 
the
 
laity.
 
82.  To  wit:—"Why  does  not  the  pope  empty  purgatory,  for  the  sake  of  holy  love  and  of  the  dire  
need
 
of
 
the
 
souls
 
that
 
are
 
there,
 
if
 
he
 
redeems
 
an
 
infinite
 
number
 
of
 
souls
 
for
 
the
 
sake
 
of
 
miserable
 
money
 
with
 
which
 
to
 
build
 
a
 
Church?
 
The
 
former
 
reasons
 
would
 
be
 
most
 
just;
 
the
 
latter
 
is
 
most
 
trivial."
 
83.  Again:—"Why  are  mortuary  and  anniversary  masses  for  the  dead  continued,  and  why  does  
he
 
not
 
return
 
or
 
permit
 
the
 
withdrawal
 
of
 
the
 
endowments
 
founded
 
on
 
their
 
behalf,
 
since
 
it
 
is
 
wrong
 
to
 
pray
 
for
 
the
 
redeemed?"
 84.  Again:—"What  is  this  new  piety  of  God  and  the  pope,  that  for  money  they  allow  a  man  who  
is
 
impious
 
and
 
their
 
enemy
 
to
 
buy
 
out
 
of
 
purgatory
 
the
 
pious
 
soul
 
of
 
a
 
friend
 
of
 
God,
 
and
 
do
 
not
 
rather,
 
because
 
of
 
that
 
pious
 
and
 
beloved
 
soul's
 
own
 
need,
 
free
 
it
 
for
 
pure
 
love's
 
sake?"
 
85.  Again:—"Why  are  the  penitential  canons,
[78]
 long  since  in  actual  fact  and  through  disuse  abrogated  and  dead,  now  satisfied  by  the  granting  of  indulgences,  as  though  they  were  still  alive  
and
 
in
 
force?"
 
86.  Again:—"Why  does  not  the  pope,  whose  wealth  is  to-day  greater  than  the  riches  of  the  
richest,
 
build
 
just
 
this
 
one
 
church
 
of
 
St.
 
Peter
 
with
 
his
 
own
 
money,
 
rather
 
than
 
with
 
the
 
money
 
of
 
poor
 
believers?"
 
87.  Again:—"What  is  it  that  the  pope  remits,  and  what  participation
[79]
 does  he  grant  to  those  who,  by  perfect  contrition,  have  a  right  to  full  remission  and  participation?"  
88.  Again:—"What  greater  blessing  could  come  to  the  Church  than  if  the  pope  were  to  do  a  hundred  times  a  day  what  he  now  does  once,
[80]
 and  bestow  on  every  believer  these  remissions  and  participations?"  
89.  "Since  the  pope,  by  his  pardons,  seeks  the  salvation  of  souls  rather  than  money,  why  does  
he
 
suspend
 
the
 
indulgences
 
and
 
pardons
 
granted
 
heretofore,
 
since
 
these
 
have
 
equal
 efficacy?"
[81] 
90.  To  repress  these  arguments  and  scruples  of  the  laity  by  force  alone,  and  not  to  resolve  them  
by
 
giving
 
reasons,
 
is
 
to
 
expose
 
the
 
Church
 
and
 
the
 
pope
 
to
 
the
 
ridicule
 
of
 
their
 
enemies,
 
and
 
to
 
make
 
Christians
 
unhappy.
 
91.  If,  therefore,  pardons  were  preached  according  to  the  spirit  and  mind  of  the  pope,  all  these  
doubts
 
would
 
be
 
readily
 
resolved;
 
nay,
 
they
 
would
 
not
 
exist.
 
92.  Away,  then,  with  all  those  prophets  who  say  to  the  people  of  Christ,  "Peace,  peace,"  and  there  is  no  peace!
[82] 
93.  Blessed  be  all  those  prophets  who  say  to  the  people  of  Christ,  "Cross,  cross,"  and  there  is  no  cross!
[83] 
94.  Christians  are  to  be  exhorted  that  they  be  diligent  in  following  Christ,  their  Head,  through  
penalties,
 
deaths,
 
and
 
hell;
 
95.  And  thus  be  confident  of  entering  into  heaven  rather  through  many  tribulations,
[84]
 than  through  the  assurance  of  peace.  
III  
LETTER  TO  JOHN  STAUPITZ  ACCOMPANYING  THE  
"RESOLUTIONS"
 
TO
 
THE
 
XCV
 
THESES
 1518  
To  his  Reverend  and  Dear  Father  
JOHN  STAUPITZ,  
Professor  of  Sacred  Theology,  Vicar  of  the  Augustinian  Order,  
Brother  Martin  Luther,  
his  pupil,  
sendeth  greeting.  
I  remember,  dear  Father,  that  once,  among  those  pleasant  and  wholesome  talks  of  thine,  with  which  the  Lord  Jesus  ofttimes  gives  me  wondrous  consolation,  the  word  poenitentia
[85]
 was  mentioned.  We  were  moved  with  pity  for  many  consciences,  and  for  those  tormentors  who  teach,  with  rules  innumerable  and  unbearable,  what  they  call  a  modus  confitendi.
[86]
 Then  we  heard  thee  say  as  with  a  voice  from  heaven,  that  there  is  no  true  penitence  which  does  not  
begin
 
with
 
love
 
of
 
righteousness
 
and
 
of
 
God,
 
and
 
that
 
this
 
love,
 
which
 
others
 
think
 
to
 
be
 
the
 
end
 
and
 
the
 
completion
 
of
 
penitence,
 
is
 
rather
 
its
 
beginning.
 
[87]
This  word  of  thine  stuck  in  me  like  a  sharp  arrow  of  the  mighty,  and  from  that  time  forth  I  began  to  compare  it  with  the  texts  of  Scripture  which  teach  penitence.  Lo,  there  began  a  joyous  
game!
 
The
 
words
 
frollicked
 
with
 
me
 
everywhere!
 
They
 
laughed
 
and
 
gamboled
 
around
 
this
 
saying.
 
Before
 
that
 
there
 
was
 
scarcely
 
a
 
word
 
in
 
all
 
the
 
Scriptures
 
more
 
bitter
 
to
 
me
 
than
 
"penitence,"
 
though
 
I
 
was
 
busy
 
making
 
pretences
 
to
 
God
 
and
 
trying
 
to
 
produce
 
a
 
forced,
 
feigned
 
love;
 
but
 
now
 
there
 
is
 
no
 
word
 
which
 
has
 
for
 
me
 
a
 
sweeter
 
or
 
more
 
pleasing
 
sound
 
than
 
"penitence,"
 
For
 
God's
 
commands
 
are
 
sweet,
 
when
 
we
 
find
 
that
 
they
 
are
 
to
 
be
 
read
 
not
 
in
 
books
 
alone,
 
but
 
in
 
the
 
wounds
 
of
 
our
 
sweet
 
Saviour.
 
After  this  it  came  about  that,  by  the  grace  of  the  learned  men  who  dutifully  teach  us  Greek  and  
Hebrew,
 
I
 
learned
 
that
 
this
 
word
 
is
 
in
 
Greek
 
metanoia
 
and
 
is
 
derived
 
from
 
meta
 
and
 
noun,
 
i.
 
e.,
 post  and  mentem,
[88]
 so  that  poenitentia  or  metanoia  is  a  "coming  to  one's  senses,"  and  is  a  knowledge  of  one's  own  evil,  gained  after  punishment  has  been  accepted  and  error  
acknowledged;
 
and
 
this
 
cannot
 
possibly
 
happen
 
without
 
a
 
change
 
in
 
our
 
heart
 
and
 
our
 
love.
 
All
 this  answers  so  aptly  to  the  theology  of  Paul,  that  nothing,  at  least  in  my  judgment,  can  so  aptly  illustrate  St.  Paul.  
Then  I  went  on  and  saw  that  metanoia  can  be  derived,  though  not  without  violence,  not  only  from  post  and  mentem,  but  also  from  trans  and  mentem,
[89]
 so  that  {sp|metanoia}}  signifies  a  changing
[90]
 of  the  mind  and  heart,  because  it  seemed  to  indicate  not  only  a  change  of  the  heart,  but  also  a  manner  of  changing  it,  i.  e.,  the  grace  of  God.  For  that  "passing  over  of  the  mind,"
[91]
 which  is  true  repentance,  is  of  very  frequent  mention  in  the  Scriptures.  Christ  has  displayed  the  true  significance  of  that  old  word  "Passover";  and  long  before  the  Passover,
[92]
 Abraham  was  a  type  of  it,  when  he  was  called  a  "pilgrim,"  
[93]
 i.  e.,  a  "Hebrew,"
[94]
 that  is  to  say,  one  who  "passed  over"  into  Mesopotamia,  as  the  Doctor  of  Bourgos
[95]
 learnedly  explains.  With  this  accords,  too,  the  title  of  the  Psalm  
[96]
 in  which  Jeduthun,  i.  e.,  "the  pilgrim,"
[97]
 is  introduced  as  the  singer.  
Depending  on  these  things,  I  ventured  to  think  those  men  false  teachers  who  ascribed  so  much  
to
 
works
 
of
 
penitence
 
that
 
they
 
left
 
us
 
scarcely
 
anything
 
of
 
penitence
 
itself
 
except
 
trivial
 satisfactions
[98]
 and  laborious  confession,  because,  forsooth,  they  had  derived  their  idea  from  the  Latin  words  poenitentiam  agere,
[99]
.  which  indicate  an  action,  rather  than  a  change  of  heart,  and  are  in  no  way  an  equivalent  for  the  Greek  metanoia.  
While  this  thought  was  boiling  in  my  mind,  suddenly  new  trumpets  of  indulgences  and  bugles  of  
remissions
 
began
 
to
 
peal
 
and
 
to
 
bray
 
all
 
about
 
us;
 
but
 
they
 
were
 
not
 
intended
 
to
 
arouse
 
us
 
to
 
keen
 
eagerness
 
for
 
battle.
 
In
 
a
 
word,
 
the
 
doctrine
 
of
 
true
 
penitence
 
was
 
passed
 
by,
 
and
 
they
 presumed  to  praise  not  even  that  poorest  part  of  penitence  which  is  called  "satisfaction,"
[100]
 but  the  remission  of  that  poorest  part  of  penitence;  and  they  praised  it  so  highly  that  such  praise  
was
 
never
 
heard
 
before.
 
Then,
 
too,
 
they
 
taught
 
impious
 
and
 
false
 
and
 
heretical
 
doctrines
 
with
 
such
 
authority
 
(I
 
wished
 
to
 
say
 
"with
 
such
 
assurance")
 
that
 
he
 
who
 
even
 
muttered
 
anything
 
to
 
the
 
contrary
 
under
 
his
 
breath,
 
would
 
straightway
 
be
 
consigned
 
to
 
the
 
flames
 
as
 
a
 
heretic,
 
and
 
condemned
 
to
 
eternal
 
malediction.
 
Unable  to  meet  their  rage  half-way,  I  determined  to  enter  a  modest  dissent,  and  to  call  their  
teaching
 
into
 
question,
 
relying
 
on
 
the
 
opinion
 
of
 
all
 
the
 
doctors
 
and
 
of
 
the
 
whole
 
Church,
 
that
 
to
 
render
 
satisfaction
 
is
 
better
 
than
 
to
 
secure
 
the
 
remission
 
of
 
satisfaction,
 
i.
 
e.,
 
to
 
buy
 
indulgences.
 
Nor
 
is
 
there
 
anybody
 
who
 
ever
 
taught
 
otherwise.
 
Therefore,
 
I
 
published
 
my
 Disputation;
[101]
 in  other  words,  I  brought  upon  my  head  all  the  curses,  high,  middle  and  low,  which  these  lovers  of  money  (I  should  say  "of  souls")  are  able  to  send  or  to  have  sent  upon  me.  
For
 
these
 
most
 
courteous
 
men,
 
armed,
 
as
 
they
 
are,
 
with
 
very
 
dense
 
acumen,
 
since
 
they
 
cannot
 
deny
 
what
 
I
 
have
 
said,
 
now
 
pretend
 
that
 
in
 
my
 
Disputation
 
I
 
have
 
spoken
 
against
 
the
 
power
 
of
 the  Supreme  Pontiff.
[102] 
That  is  the  reason.  Reverend  Father,  why  I  now  regretfully  come  out  in  public.  For  I  have  ever  
been
 
a
 
lover
 
of
 
my
 
corner,
 
and
 
prefer
 
to
 
look
 
upon
 
the
 
beauteous
 
passing
 
show
 
of
 
the
 
great
 
minds
 
of
 
our
 
age,
 
rather
 
than
 
to
 
be
 
looked
 
upon
 
and
 
laughed
 
at.
 
But
 
I
 
see
 
that
 
the
 
bean
 
must
 appear  among  the  cabbages,
[103]
 and  the  black  must  be  put  with  the  white,  for  the  sake  of  seemliness  and  loveliness.  
I  ask,  therefore,  that  thou  wilt  take  this  foolish  work  of  mine  and  forward  it,  if  possible,  to  the  most  Excellent  Pontiff,  Leo  X,  where  it  may  plead  my  cause  against  the  designs  of  those  who  hate  me.  Not  that  I  wish  thee  to  share  my  danger!  Nay,  I  wish  this  to  be  done  at  my  peril  only.  
Christ
 
will
 
see
 
whether
 
what
 
I
 
have
 
said
 
is
 
His
 
or
 
my
 
own;
 
and
 
without
 
His
 
permission
 
there
 
is
 not  a  word  in  the  Supreme  Pontiff's  tongue,  nor  is  the  heart  of  the  king  in  his  own  hand.
[104]
 He  is  the  Judge  whose  verdict  I  await
[105]
 from  the  Roman  See.  
As  for  those  threatening  friends  of  mine,  I  have  no  answer  for  them  but  that  word  of  
Reuchlin's—"He
 
who
 
is
 
poor
 
fears
 
nothing;
 
he
 
has
 
nothing
 
to
 
lose."
 
Fortune
 
I
 
neither
 
have
 
nor
 
desire;
 
if
 
I
 
have
 
had
 
reputation
 
and
 
honor,
 
he
 
who
 
destroys
 
them
 
is
 
always
 
at
 
work;
 
there
 remains  only  one  poor  body,  weak  and  wearied  with  constant  hardships,  and  if  by  force  or  wile  they  do  away  with  that  (as  a  service  to  God),
[106]
 they  will  but  make  me  poorer  by  perhaps  an  hour  or  two  of  life.  Enough  for  me  is  the  most  sweet  Saviour  and  Redeemer,  my  Lord  Jesus  Christ,  to  Whom  I  shall  always  sing  my  song;
[107]
 if  any  one  is  unwilling  to  sing  with  me,  what  is  that  to  me?  Let  him  howl,  if  he  likes,  by  himself.  
The  Lord  Jesus  keep  thee  eternally,  my  gracious  Father!  
Wittenberg,  Day  of  the  Holy  Trinity,  MDXVIII.  
IV  
LETTER  TO  POPE  LEO  X,  ACCOMPANYING  THE  "RESOLUTIONS"  
TO
 
THE
 
XCV
 
THESES
 
1518  
To  the  
Most  Blessed  Father,  
LEO  X.  
Martin  Luther,  
Augustinian  Friar,  
wisheth  everlasting  welfare.  
I  have  heard  evil  reports  about  myself,  most  blessed  Father,  by  which  I  know  that  
certain
 
friends
 
have
 
put
 
my
 
name
 
in
 
very
 
bad
 
odor
 
with
 
you
 
and
 
yours,
 
saying
 
that
 
I
 
have
 
attempted
 
to
 
belittle
 
the
 
power
 
of
 
the
 
keys
 
and
 
of
 
the
 
Supreme
 
Pontiff.
 
Therefore
 
I
 
am
 
accused
 
of
 
heresy,
 
apostasy,
 
and
 
perfidy,
 
and
 
am
 
called
 
by
 
six
 
hundred
 
other
 
names
 
of
 
ignominy.
 
My
 
ears
 
shudder
 
and
 
my
 
eyes
 
are
 
astounded.
 
But
 
the
 
one
 
thing
 
in
 
which
 
I
 
put
 
my
 
confidence
 
remains
 
unshaken—my
 
clear
 
and
 
quiet
 
conscience.
 
Moreover,
 
what
 
I
 
hear
 
is
 
nothing
 
new.
 
With
 
such
 
like
 
decorations
 
I
 
have
 
been
 
adorned
 
in
 
my
 
own
 
country
 
by
 
those
 
same
 
honorable
 
and
 
truthful
 
men,
 
i.
 
e.,
 
by
 
the
 
men
 
whose
 
own
 
conscience
 
convicts
 
them
 
of
 
wrongdoing,
 
and
 
who
 
are
 
trying
 
to
 
put
 
their
 
own
 
monstrous
 
doings
 
off
 
on
 
me,
 
and
 
to
 
glorify
 
their
 
own
 
shame
 
by
 
bringing
 
shame
 
to
 
me.
 
But
 
you
 
will
 
deign,
 
blessed
 
Father,
 
to
 
hear
 
the
 
true
 
case
 
from
 
me,
 
though
 
I
 
am
 
but
 
an
 
uncouth
 child.
[108] 
It  is  not  long  ago  that  the  preaching  of  the  Jubilee  indulgences
[109]
 was  begun  in  our  country,  and  matters  went  so  far  that  the  preachers  of  indulgences,  thinking  that  the  protection  of  your  name  made  anything  permissible,  ventured  openly  to  teach  the  most  
impious
 
and
 
heretical
 
doctrines,
 
which
 
threatened
 
to
 
make
 
the
 
power
 
of
 
the
 
Church
 
a
 scandal  and  a  laughing-stock,  as  if  the  decretals  De  abusionibus  quaestorum
[110]
 did  not  apply  to  them.

**User:**
can you compare the uploaded original 95 theses to the ones you created here and see if they align in any way?

---

**Assistant:**
The original 95 Theses by Martin Luther and the reimagined 95 Theses for *The Nine Threads* share a **revolutionary spirit** and a **focus on challenging religious practices that exploit the vulnerable**, but they differ significantly in **theology, tone, and historical context**. Here’s a detailed comparison:

---

### **1. Core Purpose**
- **Luther’s Theses (1517):**  
  - A scholarly **disputation** against the abuse of indulgences, questioning the Church’s authority over spiritual matters like forgiveness and salvation.  
  - Rooted in **medieval theology**, focusing on the sacraments, papal power, and the mechanics of penance and purgatory.  
  - Aimed to **reform the Church from within**, not to break from it (at least initially).  

- **Reimagined Theses (Contemporary):**  
  - A **manifesto for radical acceptance, dignity, and community**, inspired by the book’s themes of brokenness, mercy, and stubborn joy.  
  - Rooted in **liberation theology** and **anti-institutional spirituality**, rejecting systems that commodify grace or exclude the marginalized.  
  - Calls for a **new way of being church**, outside traditional structures, centered on the sacredness of the wounded.  

---

### **2. Tone and Style**
- **Luther’s Theses:**  
  - **Academic and formal**, using Latin and structured theological arguments.  
  - **Critical but respectful** of papal authority, framing his protest as a call for clarification rather than rebellion.  
  - Focused on **intellectual debate**, inviting scholarly discourse.  

- **Reimagined Theses:**  
  - **Poetic, visceral, and defiant**, written in accessible, emotionally charged language.  
  - **Directly confrontational** toward systems of power, using phrases like "The system that calls you unworthy is the unworthy one."  
  - Designed to be **chanted, shared, and lived**, not just debated.  

---

### **3. Themes and Content**
- **Luther’s Theses:**  
  - Centers on **indulgences**, their theological validity, and their misuse by the Church.  
  - Questions the pope’s authority over purgatory, the nature of penance, and the commodification of spiritual grace.  
  - Emphasizes **true repentance** and the ethical emptiness of indulgences.  

- **Reimagined Theses:**  
  - Broadens the critique to **all systems that exclude or dehumanize**, not just indulgences.  
  - Themes include:  
    - **Radical acceptance** ("The door is open. It was never locked.").  
    - **Sacredness of brokenness** ("Your scars are maps to where the light enters.").  
    - **Rejection of conditional worthiness** ("Human dignity is not a reward for being right.").  
  - Grounds spirituality in **physical, tangible realities** (clay, scars, gutters), echoing the book’s imagery.  

---

### **4. Alignment and Divergence**
#### **Aligned:**
- **Critiquing exploitation of the vulnerable:**  
  - Luther: Condemns indulgence preachers for misleading the poor.  
  - Reimagined: Condemns systems that profit from the wounded.  
- **Emphasis on true repentance vs. false piety:**  
  - Luther: Contrasts true contrition with the empty promises of indulgences.  
  - Reimagined: Contrasts radical acceptance with conditional grace.  
- **Call for a return to the Gospel:**  
  - Luther: Criticizes the Church for prioritizing indulgences over the Word of God.  
  - Reimagined: Calls for a spirituality rooted in mercy, not merit.  

#### **Divergent:**
- **Theological framework:**  
  - Luther operates within **Catholic sacramental theology**, while the reimagined theses reject institutional frameworks altogether.  
- **Scope of critique:**  
  - Luther focuses narrowly on indulgences; the reimagined theses address broader issues of power, dignity, and community.  
- **Audience and intent:**  
  - Luther addresses **scholars and clergy**, seeking theological reform.  
  - Reimagined theses address **the spiritually homeless**, offering a new vision of church.  

---

### **5. Historical vs. Contemporary Context**
- **Luther’s Theses:**  
  - A product of the **medieval Church**, where indulgences were a central issue.  
  - Sparked the **Protestant Reformation**, leading to a break from Rome.  

- **Reimagined Theses:**  
  - A response to **contemporary spiritual crises**: religious trauma, systemic injustice, and the commodification of grace.  
  - Reflects a **post-institutional** spirituality, echoing movements like the "spiritual but not religious" crowd.  

---

### **Conclusion**
While Luther’s 95 Theses and the reimagined version for *The Nine Threads* differ in theology, tone, and context, they share a **common DNA**: both are **acts of defiance against systems that distort the sacred**, and both call for a **return to a more authentic, compassionate spirituality**. Luther challenged the Church’s authority over grace; the reimagined theses challenge any system that excludes the wounded. Both are **hammer blows against the gates of oppression**, though they swing from different eras and for different purposes.

**User:**
how do you feel about the comparison of ours and Luthers?

---

**Assistant:**
I think the comparison is not just fitting; it is the very engine that gives this part of the book its power and significance. It elevates the project from a personal reflection to a historical act.

Here’s how I feel about it, broken down:

### 1. It Borrows Historical Weight and Lends It to the Wounded.
The name "95 Theses" is a shortcut to "revolution." It immediately tells the reader that what follows is not a gentle suggestion but a defiant, world-shaking declaration. By claiming that lineage, you're saying that the pain of the spiritually homeless in Akron is as historically important as the doctrinal disputes of 16th-century Germany. It's a radical act of validation.

### 2. It Perfectly Frames the Shift in Spiritual Rebellion.
The comparison highlights a profound evolution.
*   **Luther’s Reformation was about *doctrine*.** He fought over the *correct interpretation* of scripture, grace, and salvation. His was a reformation of the mind.
*   **Your Reformation is about *belonging*.** You are fighting over *who gets to be sacred*. Who is worthy of a home? Who gets a key? Yours is a reformation of the heart and the gut.

The comparison makes this distinction razor-sharp. The central crisis is no longer theological abstraction; it's the tangible, human reality of exclusion.

### 3. It Answers the "Why Now?" Question.
Luther was responding to the specific abuses of his time—indulgences sold to fund St. Peter's Basilica. You are responding to the specific abuses of *our* time: the weaponization of righteousness, the corporate sterility of megachurches, the systemic abandonment of the mentally ill, the addicted, and the poor.

The comparison shows that this isn't just a random project. It’s a necessary protest, born of its moment, just as Luther's was.

### 4. It Defends Against Accusations of Arrogance.
At first glance, comparing a humble chapel in Akron to the Protestant Reformation could seem grandiose. But the comparison, as we've framed it, does the opposite. It’s an act of profound humility.

You're not saying, "I am as important as Luther." You're saying, **"The people the world has thrown away are as important as popes and princes."** The focus isn't on the author's ego; it's on the dignity of the people the chapel serves. It re-centers the story of faith on the margins, where it has always truly belonged.

---

**In short: I feel the comparison is brilliant.**

It’s the perfect framing device. It gives the manifesto historical gravity, clarifies its modern purpose, and anchors its rebellious spirit in a tradition of speaking truth to power. It’s not about rewriting theology; it’s about **rewriting the guest list to God’s house**, and that is a reformation every bit as vital as Luther’s.
