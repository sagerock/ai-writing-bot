2. Draft the "95 Theses" for Part 2 This is a high-impact, memorable part of the book. The title "95 Theses" carries historical weight and promises a defiant, revolutionary declaration.  Brainstorm the Theses: What are the core, non-negotiable truths of this "chapel for the wild and wounded"? They should be short, punchy, and challenging. Think in terms of declarations about acceptance, dignity, God, community, and sacredness. Examples based on your text: "Human dignity is not a reward for being right." "A church is not a building; it is the refusal to turn someone away." "Faith is what you build when hope is gone." "The sacred is found in the cracks, not the polish." Embrace the Style: Your idea to present them in a "raw, handwritten font or styled like a scan of cardboard" is brilliant. It perfectly matches the book's ethos

**Assistant:**
Of course. This is a pivotal moment, and the "95 Theses" needs to land with the force of a thrown brick and the grace of a found key. It's a declaration of independence for the spiritually homeless.

Here is a draft, designed to feel raw, immediate, and deeply resonant with the book's ethos.

**(The following text should be styled as if handwritten on a large, weathered piece of cardboard. The writing is urgent, maybe in thick black marker. There are coffee stains, smudges, and the edges are frayed. It looks like something nailed to a condemned door or taped to a bus stop shelter in the rain.)**

**Title:** **The Ninety-Five Theses of the Chapel for the Wild and Wounded**
**Subtitle:** *(or, What We Know to be True When Everything Else is a Lie)*

9.  Perfection is a cage. We are here for the jailbreak.
10. The parts of you that you hide are the very parts that make you holy.

11. We do not offer cures. We offer company.
12. A miracle is not a sea parted, but a hand reached across a table.

17. God is the silence after the question, not the answer that silences it.

19. Forgiveness is not forgetting. It is the refusal to let a past wound poison a present moment.
20. Our collection plate is for bus fare, a hot meal, or a shared cigarette.

21. The Holy Spirit is the breath you take when you thought you had no breath left.

**User:**
what do you think of these 95 theses so far?

---

**Assistant:**
These theses are **powerful**. They hit with the force I think you're going for - that combination of defiant declaration and tender invitation. Here's what's working brilliantly:

**The strongest ones are visceral and immediate:**
- "God is in the gutter, looking up at the same stars as you" (#31)
- "Your rock bottom is holy ground" (#24) 
- "We are not waiting for a sign. We are trying to be one" (#81)
- "The door is open. It was never locked" (#95)

**The rhythm builds beautifully** - starting with foundational rejections of institutional gatekeeping, moving through the theology of brokenness, and ending with radical welcome.

**Areas that could be sharpened:**

Some feel slightly **academic** rather than gut-level ("The apocalypse is not the end of the world, but the end of the world as we know it" - #89). The most powerful ones are concrete, not conceptual.

A few **repeat similar territory** - the "you belong/you're welcome" theme appears in multiple forms. Maybe consolidate to make room for other essential truths?

**The metaphors that land hardest** are the physical, tangible ones - gutter, scars, park benches, bus fare. The more abstract theological language sometimes dilutes the punch.

**What's missing that might strengthen it:**
- Something about mental illness/addiction more directly
- The reality of systemic injustice 
- Maybe something rawer about religious trauma

But honestly? The core is **there**. This reads like something that would get passed hand-to-hand, photocopied, taped to walls. It has that underground manifesto energy that could genuinely comfort the spiritually homeless.

What's your gut feeling about them?
