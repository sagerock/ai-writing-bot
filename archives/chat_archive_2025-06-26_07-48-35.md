# The Nine Threads: A Chapel for the Wild and Wounded


# BOOK OUTLINE


---


## Intro Section (2–4 pages)

The Basilica and the Bronx Boys

In the Jewish Ghetto of Venice, after touring the impossible beauty of the Vatican, two boys from the Bronx ask a question that starts everything:

What makes a place sacred?

This book is one answer.

It was born in the broken places—Akron, Ohio, on land that has been bulldozed, rebuilt, and blessed again and again.

This is for the unchurched, the hurt, the exiled, the addicts, the angry.

This is for us.

It is not a theology.

It is a practice.

A living gospel for people building their own basilica out of ruin, mercy, and stubborn joy.

# INTRODUCTION

This book was started on our family trip to Italy. We were my wife, Rocky, our 20-year-old son, Indiana, his girlfriend, Emily, and 53-year-old me, Sage. 

Specifically, the book was started after speaking with these two wonderful Jewish young men sitting in the Campo del Ghetto Nuovo in the Jewish ghetto of Venice. 

The Venetian Jewish Ghetto, established in 1516, was Europe's first officially designated Jewish quarter. Located in the Cannaregio district of Venice, it confined the city’s Jewish population behind gates that were locked at night. Despite the restrictions, the ghetto became a vibrant center of Jewish life, with multiple synagogues, a rich intellectual culture, and distinct communities—including Ashkenazi, Sephardi, and Italian Jews—living side by side. The word “ghetto” itself originates from this very place.

This conversation happened after touring the Vatican in Rome. I was deeply conflicted by the overwhelming grandeur of Saint Peter’s Basilica.

Saint Peter’s is one of the most awe-inspiring and largest churches in the world—an enduring monument to the power, wealth, and spiritual authority of the Catholic Church during the Renaissance and Baroque eras.

Built over a century and completed in the 1600s, the basilica’s scale is staggering. Its massive dome, designed by Michelangelo, dominates the skyline. Gold, marble, and sculpture radiate a vision of heaven on earth. Bernini’s towering baldachin above the high altar and the vast, ornamented nave are designed to overwhelm—to inspire devotion through splendor.

Every detail serves a message: God's majesty, the papacy's authority, and Rome’s place as the heart of Christendom.

The Vatican itself, both a spiritual center and a sovereign city-state, was shaped by powerful patrons—above all, the popes. Figures like Julius II and Leo X were not only religious leaders but political rulers who used art and architecture to glorify God… and their own legacy.

They commissioned masters like Michelangelo, Raphael, and Bernini to rival the splendor of ancient Rome. Their projects were funded by indulgences, tithes, and the empire's wealth.

Noble families like the Medici and Barberini used their fortunes to inscribe themselves into the Church’s fabric—literally. Their crests appear in frescoes, and their names are etched into marble.

The result is confusing: a fusion of sacred devotion and worldly ambition, where worship and power meet in stone and gold.

The whole time, I'm thinking: Is this what God wanted or what the human ego wanted?

The conflicting, swirling tension of grand opulence and profound sacred devotion stirred a tremendous amount of spiritual questioning within me. 

The experience made me want to build the smallest, most humble church back in Akron on the land of the Church of the Nomadic Spirit—a defiant response to Saint Peter’s Basilica. Me, always the rebellious, angry teenager. The smallness and meekness are just as much an egocentric project as Saint Pete’s and just as much a reflection of God. Theirs: Majesty and Authority. Mine: grace and mercy. We’ll see if that becomes a thing. 

Every act of compassion I offer. Every word I write. Every video I make. They all elicit this same confusing twist of light and dark. Am I doing this for goodness or am I doing it for me? Where does God end and my ego begins? I become a walking representation of Saint Peter’s Basilica. 

But in the meantime, we went to Venice—maybe the most beautiful place I’ve ever seen. When you arrive at the Santa Lucia Train Station, the first thing you do is cross the Ponte degli Scalzi, the “Bridge of the Barefoot Monks.” It’s a simple stone bridge with wide steps, but the view from the top is unforgettable: the Grand Canal flowing beneath you, boats and gondolas weaving through the water, and the dome of San Simeone Piccolo standing quietly on the opposite bank.

All over run by endless tourists and all their luggage. Americans, Italians, Indians, Japanese, Chinese. The only thing missing was actual Venetians. Us tourists had pushed them all out. Most apartments have become short-term rentals. 

This is the summer of 2025. Locals in Barcelona are shooting tourists with water guns. All over Europe, people are rightfully upset that excessive tourism is raising the cost of living to an unaffordable point for the local people, ultimately pushing them out of their homes. 

Meanwhile, Israel is trading bombs with Iran while literally starving the people of Gaza and illegally moving deeper into the West Bank. 

My mind is filled with this heavy and complex life, and then I come upon these two Jewish guys in Venice. 

They're from New York. They've got that thick Bronx accent. I'm from Ohio. But that accent sounds like home to me. Eastern Americans, from the rustbelt of Detroit, Cleveland, Akron, and Pittsburgh, all the way into Philadelphia, Newark, and New York, are gritty and raw. I love that about us. 

I ask them how they like Venice. They say it's alright. One guy says he just returned from Israel. He says it hits different as you watch bombs from Iran flying over your head. I bet it does. 

I ask them why they are sitting out in the square. 

He shows us the tefillin.

Tefillin are a pair of small black boxes containing scrolls of Torah verses, worn by observant Jewish men during weekday morning prayers. One box is bound to the arm (tefillin shel yad) and the other to the forehead (tefillin shel rosh), symbolizing the unity of thought, feeling, and action in devotion to God.

It’s a deeply meaningful ritual, rooted in commandments from the Torah—specifically verses like “You shall bind them as a sign upon your hand and they shall be as frontlets between your eyes” (Deuteronomy 6:8).

I had never seen or heard of a tefillin before. It made me think about all the things in the world I have never heard of or seen. There will always be mystery simply because there is so much of everything. 

And then he handed us a card. “The Good Card.” It contained the Seven Laws of Noah. The Seven Laws are a set of moral and ethical guidelines in Jewish tradition that apply to all humanity, not just Jews. They come from interpretations of the Torah and rabbinic literature and are seen as the minimal requirements for righteous living for non-Jews. In essence, they form a kind of universal moral code.

He said that if everyone followed these Seven Laws, there would be peace on Earth. 

I asked him what he thought about Israel going to war with Iran. With deep sincerity and earnestness, he said, “It’s 2025. I don't understand why we still have wars.”

It’s one of those naive yet charming things young people say. They have probably always said it. But with a few more years under your belt, you realize war is inevitable. 

Around 500 BCE, Heraclitus said, “War is the father of all things.” And Einstein, with more sorrow than philosophy, warned, “So long as there are men, there will be wars.” It’s easy to wish for peace, but history, and maybe human nature, seem to resist it.

At that moment, Michelangelo’s Pietà flashed in my mind. It’s in Saint Peter’s Basilica. He carved it when he was 24. It’s easily the most powerful piece of art I've ever experienced. 

Michelangelo’s Pietà is a sculpture of the Virgin Mary cradling the dead body of Jesus after the crucifixion. Carved from a single block of Carrara marble, it rests in a quiet side chapel of Saint Peter’s Basilica, bathed in soft light. Mary’s face is serene, not anguished, but filled with a sorrow so deep it transcends expression. Her robes flow in impossibly delicate folds, and Christ’s body lies across her lap with lifeless grace. The tenderness, the stillness, the staggering beauty—it’s not just a masterpiece of technical skill, it’s a portrait of grief and love that feels almost too human to be made of stone.

That's how I feel about these young Jewish guys. A deep sorrow for their sincere wish for world peace. Their small Good Card being handed out in the ghetto of Venice on a folding card table as the massive winds of Catholic dominance and power surround them. They sit in a space where Christians made them wear signifying clothing and locked them in at night. Of course, Venice isn't the most beautiful place on Earth for them. How could it be?

I loved their card and what it represents. Dust in the wind. But still beautiful. 

It got me thinking about what ideas I would conjure to induce world peace. And that lead me to The Nine Threads. 

They came to me quite easily. Just a couple hours relaxing on a couch in a farmhouse called Holiday House in Lajotico, Italy.

Lajatico is a small hilltop town in Tuscany, Italy, best known as the birthplace of opera singer Andrea Bocelli. Surrounded by rolling vineyards and golden fields, it’s a quiet, picturesque village with deep agricultural roots. 

These 9 Threads aren't meant to replace any other list of moral guides. In fact, it would be my hope that you might someday have the mental and spiritual space in your life to create your own 3, 6, 7, 9, 10, 12 or any other number of steps to happiness, morality or world peace. 

All religious practices are just road signs to helping you live the life you feel is worth living. All of us have the light of the universe within us. Any of us have the capacity to create a new religion or idealogy. Sometimes, though, that universal light is covered up with too much junk to see it. That's ok. You can use any other person’s map to happiness or salvation that speaks to you. 

Maybe this list will mean something to you. It comes from a place of radical acceptance and deep heartfelt understanding that life is hard and it often feels like no one cares. I am deeply sorry for the suffering in your life. 

I've been given the sacred gift of getting to share in many people's profound suffering. I don't take that powerful sacred honor lightly. I have tried many ways to help the suffering of others. And I will always continue to help lessen that suffering. But I often completely fail. Often all I have left is to listen and say, “I'm so sorry.”

Please know this: People do care. I see it every day. You are loved. The universe loves you. And I love you.

# PART 1: THE NINE THREADS:

🧶 The Nine Threads

A practice of Connection(Up), Understanding(In), and Acceptance(Out)

A soul-woven pattern of how to relate, receive, and perceive in a world that is both beautiful and broken.

⸻

🌌 CONNECTION — To be is to be in relationship

(Looking Up)

How you relate to the greater whole—the cosmos, the mystery, the divine.

(Looking Up)	Belong to the Cosmos 

You are not separate from the vastness—you are its living thread.

Let yourself be claimed by the rhythm of stars and the unfolding mystery.

You are home in the infinite.

(Looking In)	Perceive the Sacred Within

The invisible reveals itself in the ordinary.

A rustling leaf, a tired sigh, a stranger’s glance—God flickers here.

The sacred often whispers

(Looking Out)	Root in the Present

This moment is not an obstacle—it’s an altar.

In breath, body, and attention, life invites you to arrive.

The present is where all things touch.

	.

⸻

🧠 UNDERSTANDING — To understand is to see with clarity and compassion

(Looking In)

How you turn inward—with humility, mercy, and grace.

(Looking Up) Stand in the Unnamed

Let the unknown be beautiful. Let it humble you.

You don’t need answers to be at peace.

(Looking In) Be Merciful With Yourself

You are not your failures. You are not your past.

Mercy says you are still becoming—and that’s enough.

(Looking Out) Offer Grace to Others

People are clumsy, complex, trying their best.

Let them be more than their worst moment.

Grace is love without prerequisites.

.

——-

🌾 ACCEPTANCE — To accept is to allow others and the world to be as they are

(Looking Out)

How you open to life as it is—its complexity, its discomfort, and its dignity.

(Looking Up) Trust the Unfolding

Let go of the illusion of mastery.

The path winds for a reason. Let it wind.

There is wisdom in the way things come together.

(Looking In) Welcome Your Shadow

There are pieces of you you’ve cast aside—too tender, too angry, too strange.

But your wholeness lives where you least expect it.

The divine doesn’t only live in your light

(Looking Out) Make Space for the Other

Welcome even what unsettles you.

Hold people with kindness, not conditions.

Human dignity is not a reward for being right.

# Part 2: The Basilica and the 95 Theses (10–15 pages)


## **The Ground We Build On**

I didn’t set out to build a church.

I didn’t even set out to build a shed.

Everywhere I look there are people who hate other people. And everyone desperately wants to be accepted.

“Maybe if I hate enough people, those people over there will accept me.”

It’s like watching sad, scared children on the playground trying to make friends because they feel so alone.

I just wanted to make a place where people felt they belonged.

Something low and stubborn and sacred.

Something that didn’t require permission from the people who always hold the keys.

A place where the walls wouldn’t ask where you came from, or what you believed, or whether you deserved to be there.

That’s how it started. A group of people no one else wanted. They just kept showing up.

I never did anything special. I just didn’t turn them away.

I didn’t say no, which is the only word the rest of the world has ever told them from the day they were born.

They appreciated that—and were deeply thankful for it.

Go figure.

And I felt this longing in my mind and body I couldn’t explain.

To accept them.

To be the father I always wanted for myself.

Strong and accepting.

I didn’t know what I was doing. I still don’t.

But I know this: Acceptance is in short supply in America today.

So I just decided to be the guy who accepted everyone.

Radical acceptance is at the heart of it all.


---

There have been hundreds of tents on this land, sheltering the hated and despised.

We put up so many tents—helped so many people—the city of Akron threatens me with jail and fines if I put up one more.

We build.

They tear down.

That has been the flow.

It’s happened so many times I don’t expect anything different.

But here’s the strange part: the process becomes its own sacred journey.

I have come to thank my oppressor for teaching me how to love and create when the expected outcome is failure and loss.

I have learned faith.

You no longer need hope when you have faith.


---

The ground here is thick with clay.

It sticks to your boots.

Cracks when it’s dry. Holds on when it’s wet.

It’s stubborn and honest—just like the people who sleep on it.

I mix it with sand. I stack rocks. I listen to the land.

There’s no manual. No plan. Just the question:

What can I build here, with what they’ve thrown away?

That’s the church.

That’s the foundation.

Not a mission. Not a program.

Just acceptance made solid.

```

**User:**
oh sorry. I just uploaded the book I'm working on. That's what I'm talking about.

---

**Assistant:**
Ah, thank you for sharing! This is beautiful, powerful work. I can feel the raw authenticity and spiritual urgency in your writing. Based on what you've shared, here are some thoughts on what you might work on next:

**Immediate priorities:**

1. **Complete the Nine Threads section** - You have the framework but each thread needs its full 2-page treatment (description + reflective questions/stories). This is your core content and feels most ready to develop.

2. **The 95 Theses** - You mention them in the outline but they're not written yet. These could be incredibly powerful given your voice and the contrast you're drawing with traditional church authority.

**Structural considerations:**

3. **Bridge the Italy experience to the Akron reality** - You have a compelling opening with the Venice encounter, but you'll want to weave that thread more clearly into how it connects to your work in Akron and the basilica you're building.

4. **The visual elements** - You mention photos/sketches of the basilica build. Gathering or creating these could really strengthen Part 2.

**Questions to help you decide:**
- Which section feels most alive to you right now when you sit down to write?
- Are you feeling more drawn to the philosophical/spiritual content (the Threads) or the manifesto/activist content (the Theses)?
- Do you have a timeline pressure, or can you let the most inspired section lead?

What's calling to you most strongly right now? The contemplative threads or the rebellious theses?
